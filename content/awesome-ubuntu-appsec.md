During application security work on Ubuntu for my job or other hobby projects, I found myself looking for useful tooling and ended up visiting Ubuntu Software several times.

Regardless of whether you’re a developer looking to design secure software or simply undertaking application security tasks, this news might interest you:

I’ve compiled [an awesome list of tools](https://github.com/iosifache/awesome-ubuntu-appsec) that can be easily installed on Ubuntu and used to safeguard your codebases.

As the repository is open source, please feel free to recommend any application security tools that you find useful. PRs are welcome!
