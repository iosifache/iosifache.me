After finishing [Innovation Labs](https://www.innovationlabs.ro/) in July 2022, [Ziarul Financiar](https://www.zf.ro) was kind enough to invite me to pitch and discuss ([recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJvVJhoT6QM)) about [MutableSecurity](https://mutablesecurity.io/) in its [**ZF IT Generation**](https://www.zf.ro/zf-it-generation/), a program dedicated to startups.

In November of the same year, the talk "_MutableSecurity: Lifeâ€™s too short. Automate everything!_" ([listing page](https://def.camp/speaker/george-andrei-iosif), [slides](https://mutablesecurity.io/blog/defcamp-2022#presentation) and [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzyHVNpSHP0)) was accepted in **[DefCamp](https://def.camp) 2022**, the largest cybersecurity conference in CEE. It was a 30-minute technical presentation of [the open source components](https://github.com/MutableSecurity) that MutableSecurity published.

The autumn of 2023 found me creating [The Open Source Fortress](https://ossfortress.io/), a workshop about finding software vulnerabilities with open source tools. I initially presented the workshop ([listing page](https://events.canonical.com/event/31/contributions/219/) and [slides](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iosifache/oss_fortress/main/presentation/ubuntu-summit-23/export.pdf)) for an hour and a half at the [**Ubuntu Summit**](https://events.canonical.com/event/31), a community conference around Ubuntu, Linux, and open source.

Immediately after the Ubuntu Summit, I got 5 minutes to pitch ([slides](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iosifache/oss_fortress/main/presentation/lightning-talk-23/export.pdf)) the workshop during the **lightning talks organised in Canonical**, with all colleagues from [Ubuntu Security Team](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam) and all other engineering teams.

In parallel with the effort to demonstrate that the barrier to entry for software security is low because of the open source tooling, I was invited to the first Ubuntu meetup in Africa (named [**Ubuntu Meetup/Workshop in Africa**](https://twitter.com/ubuntu_Africa__)). As my talk "_Open source, check, security, check: A checklist for securing open source projects_" ([slides](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iosifache/opensource-check-security-check/main/export.pdf)) was only 15 minutes, I presented a checklist of items that the maintainers need to do to secure their open source projects.

The most recent speaking opportunity was in **[DefCamp](https://def.camp) 2023**: a 30-minute talk called "*The Open Source Fortress: Finding Vulnerabilities in Your Codebase Using Open Source Tools*" ([listing page](https://def.camp/speaker/george-andrei-iosif-2/) and [slides](https://ossfortress.io/defcamp)). It presented the main vulnerability detection techniques and tools covered in [The Open Source Fortress](https://ossfortress.io/).
