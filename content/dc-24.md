I'm joining this year the [AppSec Village](https://www.appsecvillage.com) and [DEF CON](https://defcon.org) folks in challenging the old saying, "What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas".

On the 9th of August, starting at 3 p.m. for 2.5 hours, I will be hosting [the Open Source Fortress workshop](https://ossfortress.io) [in the AppSec Village as part of DEF CON](https://www.appsecvillage.com/events/dc-2024/the-open-source-fortress-finding-vulnerabilities-in-your-codebase-using-open-source-tools-677630).

The purpose of the workshop will be aligned with those from the previous conferences it was presented in, namely to empower security engineers with [public AppSec information](https://github.com/iosifache/oss_fortress) and a handy open source toolkit for vulnerability discovery. The stories may be different: no AppSec tooling at all, limited budgets for the security dept, or compute power that can be burned on new CI pipelines with quality gates. What matters is that [these tools](https://ossfortress.io/analysis-infrastructure#docker-infrastructure), put in the open by passionate people, can be used to level up the security posture of the codebases or catch bugs that other scanners missed.

The Goat-like vulnerable application that is analysed during the workshop, the [Sand Castle](https://ossfortress.io/sandcastle), also got an update. There are new XSSes, CSRFs, and SSRFs to be discovered with open source tooling. The wiki was also made more expert-friendly, with the ability to hide hints and beginner pages.

If you are at DEF CON, join the workshop! You'll leave with new AppSec knowledge and hands-on practice, some Swiss chocolate, stickers, and, for the most competitive of you, some prizes. See you in Vegas!
