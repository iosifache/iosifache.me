# Ubuntu Security Podcast

The [Ubuntu Security Team](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam) hosts [Ubuntu Security Podcast](https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/), a podcasts in which the updates of the team are presented.

Because I joined the team just before finishing my master's degree, I suggested in my first month at work that we can create a new section to the podcast to cover cybersecurity-related academic studies. [Alex Murray](https://twitter.com/alex_murray), the podcast's host, was brave enough to accept this, so I created the first academic section in May 2023.

The papers that I described, as well as the episodes in which they appeared, are as follows:

- ["*Modeling Realistic Adversarial Attacks against Network Intrusion Detection Systems*" in Ubuntu Security Podcast 194](/usp-194)
- ["*Fuzzing Configurations of Program Options*" in Ubuntu Security Podcast 199](/usp-199)
- ["*FLAME: Taming Backdoors in Federated Learning*" in Ubuntu Security Podcast 204](/usp-204)
- ["*Shedding Light on CVSS Scoring Inconsistencies: A User-Centric Study on Evaluating Widespread Security Vulnerabilities*" in Ubuntu Security Podcast 209](/usp-209)
