This list shares some of my favorite spots—places I’ve personally visited and enjoyed. It’s straight to the point, with no fluff or over-the-top opinions. If you found this because I mentioned it, just let me know if you’d like more suggestions or tips for other categories.

# Bucharest (Romania)

## Know the tips & tricks

- Don’t carry too much cash. Most places take cards (Revolut works great).  
- Skip street vendors. Shop at established stores with fair prices and receipts.  
- You’ll find English speakers in central areas (like most spots on this list).  
- Tipping isn’t required, but 10% is appreciated. Servers don’t earn much.  
- Use Uber or Bolt for rides. For a cheaper option, take the metro, buses, or train (e.g., from the airport). Avoid taxis.  
- Get data via Airalo or your carrier’s roaming plan. Airport SIM cards are overpriced.
