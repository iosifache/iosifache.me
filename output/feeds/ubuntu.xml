i'm following bug 1464064, which changed status to 'fix released' today. i understand this as "future releases will default to HTTPS for all default apt archives", and, as a dependency of this, availability of all default apt repositories supporting HTTPS. that's awesome. :)&lt;br/&gt;[15:55] -ubottu:#ubuntu-security- Bug 1464064 in Ubuntu "Ubuntu apt repos are not available via HTTPS" [Undecided, Fix Released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1464064&lt;br/&gt;[15:58] &lt;tomreyn&gt; i have a questions baout this, however. so far i understood that security.ubuntu.com served as a special archive mirror in that it provides faster access to security fixes than the main archive mirrors do. now when i compare https://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/plucky-security/ to https://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/plucky-security/ they seem to provide exactly the same. so i'm wondering: does security.ubuntu.com still provide &lt;br/&gt;[15:58] &lt;tomreyn&gt; security updates faster than the normal archive mirrors, or are security updates now provided by normal archive mirrors at the same time?&lt;br/&gt;[15:59] &lt;tomreyn&gt; (or is it something else?)&lt;br/&gt;[15:59] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; I don't have any details on why that bug was closed, but I assume it's only for the main archive and the security. repo, but not for mirrors, which means it's unlikely to be https in a default install&lt;br/&gt;[16:00] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; security.u.c comes preconfigured so that a mirror that has a delay in syncing doesn't prevent someone from getting important security updates&lt;br/&gt;[16:00] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; security.u.c is directly hosted on canonical infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;[16:01] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; in theory, a mirror that is syncing properly will get all the security updates in a timely fashion&lt;br/&gt;[16:02] &lt;tomreyn&gt; security.ubuntu.com and archive.ubuntu.com resolve to the same ip addresses for me. i'm not sure whether or not this contradicts your statement "security.u.c is directly hosted on canonical infrastructure"&lt;br/&gt;[16:04] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; archive.ubuntu.com is also hosted by canonical&lt;br/&gt;[16:04] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; the mirrors are subdomains of that, for example ca.archive.ubuntu.com&lt;br/&gt;[16:05] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; looks like ca.archive.ubuntu is a bad example :)&lt;br/&gt;[16:05] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; but it.archive.ubuntu.com is an example&lt;br/&gt;[16:05] &lt;tomreyn&gt; i know what you mean, though, some of the country mirrors will point to non canonical maintained mirror servers.&lt;br/&gt;[16:05] &lt;sdeziel&gt; tomreyn: Last I checked `archive.ubuntu.com` was pointed at the UK primary mirror but it was also redirected to the US one (those are 2 primary mirrors I know of) a while back when the UK had issues.&lt;br/&gt;[16:07] &lt;sdeziel&gt; from past experiences, `security.ubuntu.com` get fixes a tad earlier than `us.archive.ubuntu.com` does&lt;br/&gt;[16:08] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; sdeziel: they both resolve to the same ips now, so that's probably not the case anymore&lt;br/&gt;[16:09] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; oh wait, I read that wrong&lt;br/&gt;[16:09] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; yes, it's plausible that security.u.c gets updates a bit faster&lt;br/&gt;[16:10] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; hrm&lt;br/&gt;[16:10] &lt;sdeziel&gt; could it be that security fixes first land in -security and then are copied to -updates?&lt;br/&gt;[16:11] &lt;sdeziel&gt; as for the DNS, it seems that `security.ubuntu.com` now resolves to both set of IPs so UK/GB and US, that's probably more resilient now :)&lt;br/&gt;[16:11] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; so it does look like security.u.c and archive.u.c do resolve to the same ips now&lt;br/&gt;[16:12] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; in a default install, a country-specific mirror is usually configured, along with security.u.c&lt;br/&gt;[16:12] &lt;sdeziel&gt; hmm, from here, `security.ubuntu.com` resolves to the superset of `gb.archive.ubuntu.com` and `us.archive.ubuntu.com` so 6 IPs total&lt;br/&gt;[16:12] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; country specific mirrors may or may not be canonical hosted and the same as archive.u.c&lt;br/&gt;[16:13] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; so in cases where the country specific mirror isn't canonical hosted, security.u.c is important so that security updates are obtained even if the mirror is behind in syncing&lt;br/&gt;[16:13] &lt;sdeziel&gt; yep&lt;br/&gt;[16:13] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; sdeziel: yeah, same here, s.u.c and a.u.c have 6 ips, 3 from us. and 3 from uk&lt;br/&gt;[16:14] &lt;sdeziel&gt; I am quite happy with the change as-is, even if that may or may not be something enabled by default in the future&lt;br/&gt;[16:14] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; yes, at least it's easy now to opt-in to it&lt;br/&gt;[16:15] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; the mirrors were always the major issue&lt;br/&gt;[17:09] &lt;tomreyn&gt; thanks for the discussion, mdeslaur and sdeziel. so i think what remains to be understood is: why was bug 1464064 marked as "fix released" when the bug is about (my, much simplified, interpretation - open to discussion) "new installations should always use apt repositories using httpS and still get fast security updates"&lt;br/&gt;[17:09] -ubottu:#ubuntu-security- Bug 1464064 in Ubuntu "Ubuntu apt repos are not available via HTTPS" [Undecided, Fix Released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1464064&lt;br/&gt;[17:11] &lt;tomreyn&gt; i guess another way to read the bug report is "apt archive mirrors us.archive.ubuntu.com and security.ubuntu.com should support HTTPS", which is a very different interpretation, and - i think - not what the original report (nor most of the contributors) seemed to intend.&lt;br/&gt;[17:12] &lt;tomreyn&gt; i think the first interpretation is what is the revolution that people are seeking, and the second interpretation is maybe what the current state is.&lt;br/&gt;[17:13] &lt;tomreyn&gt; (and, to explain this as well, i'm discussing this here for the potential time-to-patch security impact)&lt;br/&gt;[17:29] &lt;tomreyn&gt; I just posted this to the bug report as well (spelling out potential interpretation 1 more).&lt;br/&gt;[17:47] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; yeah, I think commenting in the bug is the best thing to do, thanks&lt;br/&gt;[17:58] &lt;oerheks&gt; apt-transport-https  is optional, and one needs ca-certificates too to make it work&lt;br/&gt;[17:59] &lt;tomreyn&gt; apt-transport-https is a transitional package because this functionality (HTTPS support) has been implemented in core apt years ago.&lt;br/&gt;[18:00] &lt;oerheks&gt; oh oke, the ca-certificates is the culprit?&lt;br/&gt;[18:04] &lt;tomreyn&gt; i don't think ca-certificates is an issue. ca-certificates is a core package, installed by default since forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">06.12.2024: ubuntu-security</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>05.12.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</title><description># UBUNTU-SECURITY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=== crazybyte28 is now known as crazybyte2&lt;br/&gt;=== tsimonq2_ is now known as tsimonq2&lt;br/&gt;=== JanC is now known as Guest3359&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;# UBUNTU-MEETING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[16:00] &lt;Skia&gt;

This is true and we don't have a clear way to solve this&lt;br/&gt;[16:18] &lt;juliank&gt; We could run every 5 minutes I guess&lt;br/&gt;[16:19] &lt;juliank&gt; I'm not sure we should be fetching a lot of data and decompress them using all your CPU cores and whatnot on battery&lt;br/&gt;[16:19] &lt;adrien&gt; I think it's a pretty common situation in other operating systems: at some point there is an expectation that your machine/device is in a state where background updates can happen&lt;br/&gt;[16:19] &lt;juliank&gt; If we design a nice daemon we could have it e.g. download 1 package and upgrade that and it rate limits itself when on battery&lt;br/&gt;[16:20] &lt;bdrung&gt; how about having these services ignore the ConditionACPower=true in case their update was $x days ago and the system is not low on power?&lt;br/&gt;[16:20] &lt;adrien&gt; but what may want is something that _wait_ for the conditions rather than checks them every n minutes&lt;br/&gt;[16:20] &lt;juliank&gt; See, ConditionACPower just skips, it doesn't wait&lt;br/&gt;[16:20] &lt;waveform&gt; indeed, some condition that can check AC or battery &gt;=75% (insert arbitrary level here) rather than straight AC&lt;br/&gt;[16:21] &lt;juliank&gt; And then we need to stop unattended-upgrades once power level goes low&lt;br/&gt;[16:21] &lt;juliank&gt; But also we disable suspend&lt;br/&gt;[16:21] &lt;juliank&gt; In  any case this can't be solved at a bug level, it needs a complete epic and stories&lt;br/&gt;[16:21] &lt;waveform&gt; true&lt;br/&gt;[16:22] &lt;adrien&gt;

Do you affirm that you have read and understood the whole document, and do you agree to be bound by the terms for the duration of your membership should it be granted?&lt;br/&gt;[20:02] &lt;andrew_46&gt; Yes I have read and understand the whole document and I agree to be bound&lt;br/&gt;[20:02] &lt;Wild_Man&gt;  We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.&lt;br/&gt;[20:02] &lt;Kilos&gt; great&lt;br/&gt;[20:02] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; ðð»&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;Wild_Man&gt; The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;Wild_Man&gt; Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;Wild_Man&gt; provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;Wild_Man&gt; During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.&lt;br/&gt;[20:04] &lt;Wild_Man&gt; When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)&lt;br/&gt;[20:04] &lt;Wild_Man&gt; Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...&lt;br/&gt;[20:04] &lt;Wild_Man&gt; #topic andrew_46&lt;br/&gt;[20:05] &lt;Wild_Man&gt; So, first up we have andrew_46, could you please introduce yourself to the board, share your pre-written statement, and share the links to your wiki page and launchpad accountâ¦&lt;br/&gt;[20:06] &lt;andrew_46&gt; Hi!

But both teams had some attempts at enabling it in the past..&lt;br/&gt;[15:49] &lt;liushuyu&gt; ... and the trouble is, from the LP bug, I can't see what's blocking the task&lt;br/&gt;[15:50] &lt;slyon&gt; src:dbus is owned by Foundations, so in theory dbus-broker would be a good fit to be owned by Foundations, too.&lt;br/&gt;[15:51] &lt;slyon&gt; liushuyu: the blocker is having dbus and dbus-broker installed in parallel&lt;br/&gt;[15:51] &lt;slyon&gt; gdm needs dbus-run-session (https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gdm/-/blob/main/daemon/gdm-session.c#L2973) which is tightly coupled with src:dbus&lt;br/&gt;[15:51] &lt;liushuyu&gt; slyon: In thoery yes, but you see this kinda breaks GNOME desktop because some components use the legacy `dbus-run-session` thing&lt;br/&gt;[15:51] &lt;slyon&gt; so we either need to adopt gdm, or need a drop-in replacement for dbus-run-session&lt;br/&gt;[15:51] &lt;liushuyu&gt; but we now have several implementations for that&lt;br/&gt;[15:52] &lt;slyon&gt; those implementation need to be packaged, tested &amp; shipped. Then a new case can be made to move the dbus-broker MIR forward. IMO that should be the next step&lt;br/&gt;[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yes to the above&lt;br/&gt;[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I answered the open questions on the bug&lt;br/&gt;[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; TL;DR&lt;br/&gt;[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; 1. I really recommend one team&lt;br/&gt;[15:53] &lt;liushuyu&gt; slyon: I see, then the issue would be there needs to be some communications between Desktop and Foundations to figure out how to perform the transitions&lt;br/&gt;[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; 2. ubuntu-security is the team to subscribe if it is them&lt;br/&gt;[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yes liushuyu&lt;br/&gt;[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it seems like neither can do it alone&lt;br/&gt;[15:54] &lt;slyon&gt; yes. liushuyu does that help to clarify the next steps?&lt;br/&gt;[15:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm so glad it is late 2024 and not late 2025 being in this state&lt;br/&gt;[15:54] &lt;liushuyu&gt; slyon: Yes&lt;br/&gt;[15:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; great&lt;br/&gt;[15:54] &lt;liushuyu&gt; ah, sorry, wrong ping&lt;br/&gt;[15:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; then the case i had in mind&lt;br/&gt;[15:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mdevctl/+bug/1889248&lt;br/&gt;[15:55] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 1889248 in libonig (Ubuntu Focal) "[MIR] mdevctl, jq, libonig" [Undecided, New]&lt;br/&gt;[15:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; this is about the request to also promote jq in focal (it is in main in &gt;=Jammy)&lt;br/&gt;[15:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I've evaluated the differences and considered it an ack&lt;br/&gt;[15:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; security had a look as well, also an ack&lt;br/&gt;[15:56] &lt;slyon&gt; delta should be relatively small, considering we have 1.6 in foca-updates and jammy-release&lt;br/&gt;[15:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; as a bonus utkarsh will work on adding autopkgtests of it to devel&lt;br/&gt;[15:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; this is a "speak now or forever hold your peace" moment in case you disagree&lt;br/&gt;[15:56] &lt;liushuyu&gt; cpaelzer: I'm so glad it is late 2024 and not late 2025 being in this state &gt; I think you would wish for that, because systemd people might pull out their new Varlink (tm) technology to replace D-Bus&lt;br/&gt;[15:56] &lt;slyon&gt; lgtm&lt;br/&gt;[15:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; liushuyu: yeah I've read about that&lt;br/&gt;[15:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; jamespage: joalif: any objections?&lt;br/&gt;[15:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and also - any other topic?&lt;br/&gt;[15:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; nothing more from me&lt;br/&gt;[15:57] &lt;slyon&gt; nothing here&lt;br/&gt;[15:57] &lt;jamespage&gt; none&lt;br/&gt;[15:58] &lt;liushuyu&gt; No at the moment from me, but I might bring up "Rust code in main" situation&lt;br/&gt;[15:58] &lt;joalif&gt; nothing from me&lt;br/&gt;[15:58] &lt;liushuyu&gt; ... maybe next time?&lt;br/&gt;[15:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; from experience that blows the session time, but yeah let us go for it&lt;br/&gt;[15:58] &lt;liushuyu&gt; (considering we are running out of time)&lt;br/&gt;[15:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; next time&lt;br/&gt;[15:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; 2 minutes will not allow for any progress&lt;br/&gt;[15:58] &lt;slyon&gt; liushuyu: sure!

Could you please introduce yourself?&lt;br/&gt;[19:17] &lt;mirespace&gt; Hello. My name is Miriam EspaÃ±a Acebal (two surnames), and I work as a distro engineer in the CPC team at Canonical, where I started in 7/2021 in the Server team. I usually deal with Microsoft-related packages because I'm on the Azure team. My last adventures involve WALinuxagent and the to-be-packaged rust-based GuestProxyAgent, but I also dedicate time to general distro work.&lt;br/&gt;[19:17] &lt;mirespace&gt; My application was linked above&lt;br/&gt;[19:19] &lt;schopin&gt; Thanks :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:19] &lt;mirespace&gt; yw :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:19] &lt;teward&gt; because i'm not caffeinated enough yet today, CPC = ?  (For the IRC logs)&lt;br/&gt;[19:19] &lt;mirespace&gt; Canonical Public Cloud (sorry!)&lt;br/&gt;[19:20] &lt;teward&gt; no worries, i should know this but i haven't had enough coffee :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:20] &lt;schopin&gt; I don't think even I knew that the first C was for Canonical.&lt;br/&gt;[19:20] &lt;mirespace&gt; I think that there is a debate on that... in the last sprint, we only have Public Cloud in our badges&lt;br/&gt;[19:25] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK so I'll start I guess! Let's say that it's after feature freeze in the cycle, and you're considering a package update from 1.2.3-1 to 1.2.4-0ubuntu1. What do you need to check for compliance with feature freeze, if anything?&lt;br/&gt;[19:26] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; hey heey&lt;br/&gt;[19:26] &lt;mirespace&gt; No new features  and/or ABI/API changes for a package can be uploaded after Feature Freeze, so I would check that first&lt;br/&gt;[19:26] &lt;teward&gt; o/ utkarsh2102&lt;br/&gt;[19:26] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; can someone send a scrollback please?&lt;br/&gt;[19:27] &lt;rbasak&gt; mirespace: OK! So say that you look and there is a small feature change. You think the release team might grant an exception. How should you ask them for one?&lt;br/&gt;[19:27] &lt;schopin&gt; utkarsh2102: done, check MM&lt;br/&gt;[19:28] &lt;mirespace&gt; I will create a bug requesting a FeatureFreezeException following https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FreezeExceptionProcess&lt;br/&gt;[19:29] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; thanks, schopin! o/&lt;br/&gt;[19:29] &lt;mirespace&gt; I can also ask in the ubuntu-release channel if someone on the release team can take a lok if I'm not sure enough, or tag the bug&lt;br/&gt;[19:30] &lt;mirespace&gt; ubuntu-release tag&lt;br/&gt;[19:31] &lt;mirespace&gt; Depending on what moment of the cycle we were, for no bother a lot the release team if they are in a critical task&lt;br/&gt;[19:31] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm not aware of an ubuntu-release tag. Is that documented anywhere?&lt;br/&gt;[19:31] &lt;mirespace&gt; s/lok/look/&lt;br/&gt;[19:31] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; it's subscribing ~ubuntu-release not tagging the bug :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:31] &lt;mirespace&gt; https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FreezeExceptionProcess, the last point on FeatureFreeze for new upstream versions&lt;br/&gt;[19:32] &lt;mirespace&gt; yes, true&lt;br/&gt;[19:32] &lt;mirespace&gt; my fault&lt;br/&gt;[19:32] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:33] &lt;rbasak&gt; So let's say that your FFe is granted, and you upload. It then gets "stuck in proposed". What does this mean, and where do you find documentation on how to handle this situation?&lt;br/&gt;[19:33] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; question: I see Christian sponsoring a lot of uploads - at least definitely reviews - why is he not endorsing the application?&lt;br/&gt;[19:33] &lt;mirespace&gt; That means that the migration process  is failing at some point (test regressions, FTBFS, ...)&lt;br/&gt;[19:34] &lt;mirespace&gt; Documentation about this can be find at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ProposedMigration&lt;br/&gt;[19:34] &lt;mirespace&gt; and also at https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-maintainers-handbook/blob/main/ProposedMigration.md&lt;br/&gt;[19:34] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; so what do you do then - if you see something that has not migrated, what are the next steps?&lt;br/&gt;[19:34] &lt;mirespace&gt; I coul check if the package appears at https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses.html&lt;br/&gt;[19:35] &lt;mirespace&gt; utkarsh2102: cpaelzer_ sponsored my ServerApplication, maybe that's the reason&lt;br/&gt;[19:36] &lt;mirespace&gt; Once, in the update_excuses,  I could check if there is a regression marked in some of the autopkgatest ran, for some architectures also&lt;br/&gt;[19:36] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; what if it's not listed there?&lt;br/&gt;[19:36] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; and the package is still not migrating&lt;br/&gt;[19:37] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; well, it's listed there but there's nothing informational :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:37] &lt;mirespace&gt; I could check britney output https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_output.txt&lt;br/&gt;[19:37] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; coolio&lt;br/&gt;[19:37] &lt;mirespace&gt; To see if some dependencies problem arose&lt;br/&gt;[19:37] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; what would you if you see your package there?&lt;br/&gt;[19:38] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; let's say you upload "moarvm" package&lt;br/&gt;[19:38] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; and it's listed there as:&lt;br/&gt;[19:38] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; trying: moarvm&lt;br/&gt;[19:38] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; skipped: moarvm (0, 6, 681)&lt;br/&gt;[19:38] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt;

what does that mean&lt;br/&gt;[19:38] &lt;mirespace&gt; I tried to fix something like that with a R package, following Adrien Nader recommendation in ubunut-devel mail list&lt;br/&gt;[19:38] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; what will you do next?&lt;br/&gt;[19:39] &lt;mirespace&gt; Is trying to install moarvm, but skipping in armhf arch&lt;br/&gt;[19:40] &lt;mirespace&gt; The numbers I think are related to attemps&lt;br/&gt;[19:40] &lt;mirespace&gt; and I probably will look for that dependencies to see if something are preventing that for installing in that arch&lt;br/&gt;[19:40] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; hm, okeydoke&lt;br/&gt;[19:40] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; sorry for hijacking, rbasak - back to you!&lt;br/&gt;[19:41] &lt;schopin&gt; mirespace: Let's say you're about to upload a merge of a library from Debian, how would you check for possible transitions it would trigger?&lt;br/&gt;[19:41] &lt;mirespace&gt; I should read more on britney doc&lt;br/&gt;[19:42] &lt;mirespace&gt; I would check the reverse dependencies the library has&lt;br/&gt;[19:42] &lt;schopin&gt; What would you check them for?&lt;br/&gt;[19:43] &lt;mirespace&gt; if there is some ABI chekcs, I would check if looking for that changes in the rdependencies qith objdump, for example&lt;br/&gt;[19:43] &lt;mirespace&gt; s/chekcs/changes/&lt;br/&gt;[19:44] &lt;mirespace&gt; s/qith/with&lt;br/&gt;[19:44] &lt;mirespace&gt; I did that for https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/heimdal/+bug/2036253&lt;br/&gt;[19:44] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2036253 in heimdal (Ubuntu Noble) "FTBFS: missing strl* symbols fail the build" [Undecided, Fix Released]&lt;br/&gt;[19:44] &lt;mirespace&gt; Which is the most similar to a transition I worked on&lt;br/&gt;[19:44] &lt;schopin&gt; A fairly special case :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:45] &lt;schopin&gt; Assuming upstream and Debian know of the ABI breakage, how would that show in the new version of the package?&lt;br/&gt;[19:45] &lt;schopin&gt; For that hypothetical, let's assume intentional breakage rather than one caused by toolchains&lt;br/&gt;[19:46] &lt;mirespace&gt; Ah, that question has a trick I remember ....&lt;br/&gt;[19:47] &lt;mirespace&gt; I'm checking this  because I don't remember  https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-kernel-handbook/ch-versions.html&lt;br/&gt;[19:47] &lt;mirespace&gt; mmm ... too quick that is for the kernel&lt;br/&gt;[19:48] &lt;schopin&gt; are you familiar with the concept of soname?&lt;br/&gt;[19:48] &lt;mirespace&gt; I waS CHECKING https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-sharedlibs.html#dependencies-between-the-packages-of-the-same-library&lt;br/&gt;[19:50] &lt;mirespace&gt; soname : shared object name, I used it with simbol changes&lt;br/&gt;[19:51] &lt;schopin&gt; How is it used in the packaging of a library?&lt;br/&gt;[19:51] &lt;mirespace&gt; And the bump to the new version is made because they need to be installable concurrently&lt;br/&gt;[19:52] &lt;mirespace&gt; libfoo-version.so&lt;br/&gt;[19:53] &lt;mirespace&gt; or libfoo.so.version&lt;br/&gt;[19:53] &lt;rbasak&gt; So on my system libjpeg-turbo8 ships /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjpeg.so.8.2.2. What's the soname likely to be?&lt;br/&gt;[19:53] &lt;mirespace&gt; 8.2.2&lt;br/&gt;[19:53] &lt;rbasak&gt; (and it also ships /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjpeg.so.8 -&gt; libjpeg.so.8.2.2)&lt;br/&gt;[19:54] &lt;mirespace&gt; JPEG_8.2.2&lt;br/&gt;[19:56] &lt;rbasak&gt; May I move on from transitions and ask a final question?&lt;br/&gt;[19:56] &lt;schopin&gt; Alas, no, it would be libjpeg.so.8&lt;br/&gt;[19:57] &lt;schopin&gt; rbasak: fine with me.&lt;br/&gt;[19:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; mirespace: let's say you add a delta to package in universe during +1 maintenance. How will you ensure that it doesn't get left behind in the next cycle if Debian updates the package and it doesn't autosync because of the delta? What's the process in Ubuntu to ensure that this doesn't happen, for a package in universe?&lt;br/&gt;[19:58] &lt;mirespace&gt; Oh, yes... I cannot process under  nervouss, sorry: clear here: AÂ shlibsÂ file represents an SONAME as a library name and version number, such asÂ libfooÂ VERSION, instead of recording the actual SONAME. If the SONAME doesnât match one of the two expected formats (libfoo-VERSION.soÂ orÂ libfoo.so.VERSION), it cannot be represented, in the doc I linked above&lt;br/&gt;[19:59] &lt;mirespace&gt;  - Ways to follow-up later changes in merges:&lt;br/&gt;[19:59] &lt;mirespace&gt;         - If it needs a patch, because weâre modifying code outside debian folder in quilt format (3.0), we can put there in the description of the patch following DEP3 guidelines&lt;br/&gt;[19:59] &lt;mirespace&gt;         - If the merge review was done through MR in Launchpad, put it there, being careful of having the bug linked to the MR.&lt;br/&gt;[19:59] &lt;mirespace&gt;         - You can add a final comment to the bug&lt;br/&gt;[19:59] &lt;mirespace&gt;         - You can add a more descriptive comment in the commit that probably would be affected in the future merge&lt;br/&gt;[20:00] &lt;rbasak&gt; I don't think that answered my question. Can you try reading it again please? Take your time, and ask me to clarify if you need.&lt;br/&gt;[20:00] &lt;schopin&gt; FYI, we're out of time so i'll call for a vote after that question has been answered.&lt;br/&gt;[20:01] &lt;mirespace&gt; Merges in universe will appear at https://merges.ubuntu.com/universe.html?showProposed=true&amp;showMergeNeeded=true&amp;showLongBinaries=true&lt;br/&gt;[20:02] &lt;rbasak&gt; Yes - they'll appear there - but what's the *process* to ensure that an Ubuntu package with a delta won't languish in that report forever?&lt;br/&gt;[20:02] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; i've also had questions - i'm not super decided yet but time constraints,, oh well :)&lt;br/&gt;[20:02] &lt;mirespace&gt; rbask: the question is how the package appears on MOm or how we handle oa package that appears in mom?&lt;br/&gt;[20:02] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; rbasak: i have a hard stop - it's 1:32 AM here. do you want to do votes already?&lt;br/&gt;[20:02] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; teward, schopin?&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;schopin&gt; I'm also close to my hard stop.&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;teward&gt; i don't have a hard stop but my need for caffeine is making me hit one&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;mirespace&gt; filling a bug for the next merge, subscribing someone also (the last autor)&lt;br/&gt;=== ebarretto_ is now known as ebarretto&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK I think we need to move on to voting :-/&lt;br/&gt;[20:04] &lt;mirespace&gt; or a team that has it in the team mapping package&lt;br/&gt;[20:04] &lt;schopin&gt; #vote Miriam to get MOTU rights&lt;br/&gt;[20:04] &lt;meetingology&gt; Please vote on: Miriam to get MOTU rights&lt;br/&gt;[20:04] &lt;meetingology&gt; Public votes can be registered by saying +1, -1 or +0 in channel (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1|-1|+0 #channelname')&lt;br/&gt;[20:06] &lt;rbasak&gt; -1&lt;br/&gt;[20:06] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm not sure on your understanding of transitions. I think you might understand enough to know when to ask questions though. You see to understand the packaging uninstallability / migration side, but perhaps not the mapping from soname to binary side so well.&lt;br/&gt;[20:06] &lt;meetingology&gt; -1 received from rbasak&lt;br/&gt;[20:07] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm also not so sure on your understanding of Ubuntu's merge process. I'm concerned that delta in Ubuntu will be left behind to languish.&lt;br/&gt;[20:07] &lt;rbasak&gt; I was willing to give you the benefit of the doubt on one of those two topics, but I don't think I can for both, sorry! I think you're really close though. Please keep up the good work!&lt;br/&gt;[20:07] &lt;schopin&gt; -1 Robie basically wrote much faster than I could organize my thoughts but it's a very similar reasoning.&lt;br/&gt;[20:07] &lt;meetingology&gt; -1 Robie basically wrote much faster than I could organize my thoughts but it's a very similar reasoning. received from schopin&lt;br/&gt;[20:08] &lt;rbasak&gt; I also appreciate that this may be a matter of not conveying understanding in a stressful IRC meeting :-/&lt;br/&gt;[20:08] &lt;mirespace&gt; And I'm sorry, I'm not exposed to transitions per se... I need to look for them with someone who wants&lt;br/&gt;[20:09] &lt;schopin&gt; mirespace: A good way to touch transitions during +1 shifts is to work on NBS packages, as those are usually a symptom of ongoing transitions.&lt;br/&gt;[20:10] &lt;mirespace&gt; schopin: thanks for the trick, crossing finger for my next shift hold something related&lt;br/&gt;[20:10]  * rbasak needs to go now, sorry&lt;br/&gt;[20:12] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; -1; i was mostly +0 as I was not super decided as of yet. I've seen Miriam do good work on the CPC side and managing other things but on the other, I feel there's a room for improvement, needed for MOTU. Whilst the answers lead me towards -1, I am also not happy with the endorsements - few endorsers have only sponsored a limited number of packages.&lt;br/&gt;[20:12] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; Those who have sponsored more haven't endorsed the application. I'd also like to see if that can be fixed for the next time. But as I said, Miriam is doing great stuff and I look forward to seeing her get MOTU and then eventually core-dev pretty soon!&lt;br/&gt;[20:12] &lt;meetingology&gt; -1; i was mostly +0 as I was not super decided as of yet.

Additionally, I agree the issue with your endorsements is concerning since none of the primary sponsors of your work endorsed things, which makes me a little concerned they may have intentionally not endorsed you.&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;schopin&gt; #endvote&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;meetingology&gt; Voting ended on: Miriam to get MOTU rights&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;meetingology&gt; Votes for: 0, Votes against: 4, Abstentions: 0&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;meetingology&gt; Motion denied&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;mirespace&gt; Thank you all&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;schopin&gt; #action schopin to announce the results on the ML.&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: schopin to announce the results on the ML.&lt;br/&gt;[20:17] &lt;mirespace&gt; It's the problem or being in a no-distro team&lt;br/&gt;[20:17] &lt;mirespace&gt; s/or/of/... nut that's known :)&lt;br/&gt;[20:17] &lt;schopin&gt; So sorry, I really have to run so I call this meeting to an end (at least as far as the bot is concerned)&lt;br/&gt;[20:17] &lt;schopin&gt; #endmeeting&lt;br/&gt;[20:17] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting ended at 20:17:39 UTC.

This way we can just sync the whole package back in the future&lt;br/&gt;[16:30] &lt;rbasak&gt; Would you hold up proposed migration in Ubuntu while you wait on a response from a maintainer in Debian?&lt;br/&gt;[16:31] &lt;rbasak&gt; (let's say you have a patch ready, and it doesn't have wider implications to just apply in Ubuntu)&lt;br/&gt;[16:32] &lt;danilogondolfo&gt; rbasak, no, waiting for a response can take a unknown amount of time. My experience is that the core-dev will accept merges with the condition we'll keep an eye in the package. For these cases we'll keep an LP bug opened for tracking&lt;br/&gt;[16:33] &lt;danilogondolfo&gt; fixing the thing on Ubuntu while we wait for Debian might unblock many other things that were waiting on that migration&lt;br/&gt;[16:33] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK, so let's say that happens, and the package migrates. What do you expect to happen in the future such that the package can be synced in the future, as you suggest above?&lt;br/&gt;[16:34] &lt;teward&gt; (returned, sorry for my disappearance)&lt;br/&gt;[16:34] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm asking specifically about your process to detect that situation when it occurs&lt;br/&gt;[16:34] &lt;rbasak&gt; ...so that you know to act.&lt;br/&gt;[16:39] &lt;danilogondolfo&gt; rbasak, I'd track the Debian bug in the LP bug and/or keep an eye on the merge proposal periodically. If there is a new package to be sync while the development window on Ubuntu is opened I'd request a sync. If we are at feature freeze and the thing it not critical I'd wait until the next release. In any case, when a new package is available with the patch, we'll see it in merge-o-matic so we would see it and&lt;br/&gt;[16:39] &lt;danilogondolfo&gt; investigate the status&lt;br/&gt;[16:40] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK&lt;br/&gt;[16:41] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; how would another person doing the package merge know about all of this?&lt;br/&gt;[16:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; Possibly the same question: "we would see it" -&gt; who is "we"? What's the process for ensuring that such a package does get attention?&lt;br/&gt;[16:44] &lt;danilogondolfo&gt; utkarsh2102, well it's a good practice to look at LP bugs when working on a merge. Like, when I start the merge and see a delta I will check if it could be dropped, ideally there will be an LP bug about it with all the details. At least the changelog should point me to the bug report so I can investigate the delta&lt;br/&gt;[16:45] &lt;rbasak&gt; danilogondolfo: I'm not really seeing the answer I'm looking for, so let me rephrase: how is it that someone doing a package merge for a package in universe where the delta got added as part of +1 maintenance actually ended up looking to merge that package in the first place?&lt;br/&gt;[16:46] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; that's pretty much giving it away, Robie :)&lt;br/&gt;[16:46] &lt;rbasak&gt; I agree it'll show up in MoM. But what's the process for getting from a package being listed in MoM, to someone actually merging it?&lt;br/&gt;[16:46] &lt;rbasak&gt; Who is responsible?&lt;br/&gt;[16:46] &lt;danilogondolfo&gt; rbasak, some teams, such as Foundations, have weekly meeting to deal with the archive. It's a collective effort to ensure that things will migrate, FTBFSs are fixed. We also assign bug to teams so people will look at them every week.&lt;br/&gt;[16:47] &lt;rbasak&gt; danilogondolfo: AFAIK, that doesn't apply to packages in universe though?&lt;br/&gt;[16:47] &lt;bdrung&gt; danilogondolfo, and for universe packages?&lt;br/&gt;[16:49] &lt;danilogondolfo&gt; for packages in universe whoever is doing the +1 shift will, eventually, look at them&lt;br/&gt;[16:49] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; ok, we're nearing the time limit - I am ready to vote.&lt;br/&gt;[16:49] &lt;teward&gt; so am I&lt;br/&gt;[16:49] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; rbasak, bdrung?&lt;br/&gt;[16:49] &lt;bdrung&gt; danilogondolfo, imagine you found a bug in glibc while working on netplan and you developed a patch for it. What would be your next steps?&lt;br/&gt;[16:50] &lt;rbasak&gt; Given the time, I agree we need to move to voting.&lt;br/&gt;[16:50] &lt;bdrung&gt; (I had no time to place my question)&lt;br/&gt;[16:50] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; go on, we'll wait for you :)&lt;br/&gt;[16:51] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; given Danilo replies quickly enough ;)&lt;br/&gt;[16:51] &lt;danilogondolfo&gt; ok, should I answer that one?&lt;br/&gt;[16:51] &lt;danilogondolfo&gt; ok&lt;br/&gt;[16:51] &lt;teward&gt; should I answer that one? &gt; yes&lt;br/&gt;[16:53] &lt;danilogondolfo&gt; bdrung, well, I'd first reach out to the maintainer on Ubuntu as glibc is super important. If the patch is accepted I'd work with them to get it merged in the package and submitted upstream.&lt;br/&gt;[16:53] &lt;bdrung&gt; danilogondolfo, thanks.&lt;br/&gt;[16:53] &lt;bdrung&gt; I am ready to vote.&lt;br/&gt;[16:54] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; woot&lt;br/&gt;[16:54] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; #voters bdrung, rbasak, teward, utkarsh2102&lt;br/&gt;[16:54] &lt;meetingology&gt; Current voters: bdrung, rbasak, teward, utkarsh2102&lt;br/&gt;[16:54] &lt;rbasak&gt; -1 reasons to follow&lt;br/&gt;[16:55] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; #vote Danilo to get Core Dev rights&lt;br/&gt;[16:55] &lt;meetingology&gt; Please vote on: Danilo to get Core Dev rights&lt;br/&gt;[16:55] &lt;meetingology&gt; Public votes can be registered by saying +1, -1 or +0 in channel (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1|-1|+0 #channelname')&lt;br/&gt;[16:55] &lt;teward&gt; try that again rbasak :P&lt;br/&gt;[16:55] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; rbasak was toooooo eager, tch tch&lt;br/&gt;[16:55] &lt;rbasak&gt; -1 reasons to follow&lt;br/&gt;[16:55] &lt;meetingology&gt; -1 reasons to follow received from rbasak&lt;br/&gt;[16:55] &lt;rbasak&gt; Sorry, busy writing up my rationale!&lt;br/&gt;[16:58] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; -1; for a person going to core dev directly, I expect them to be excellent in at least knowing most of the things/terminologies/processes about Ubuntu and demonstrating experience in some of them (ideally, all of them). In your particular case, I didn't see any merges, regular SRUs, etc and also not the answers we were looking for. I think the&lt;br/&gt;[16:58] &lt;meetingology&gt; -1; for a person going to core dev directly, I expect them to be excellent in at least knowing most of the things/terminologies/processes about Ubuntu and demonstrating experience in some of them (ideally, all of them). In your particular case, I didn't see any merges, regular SRUs, etc and also not the answers we were looking for. I think the received from utkarsh2102&lt;br/&gt;[16:58] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; right path foward would be, at least, MOTU -&gt; Core Dev (unless you want to start by netplan PPU). Anyway, we appreciate your work and I'd really like to see you get core-dev soon but I'm afraid there's quite a lot of work needed to get there. Apologies it didn't work out this time.&lt;br/&gt;[16:59] &lt;rbasak&gt; I need to go very soon so I'll post my rationale now.&lt;br/&gt;[16:59] &lt;teward&gt; -1 (short rationale to follow)&lt;br/&gt;[16:59] &lt;meetingology&gt; -1 (short rationale to follow) received from teward&lt;br/&gt;[17:00] &lt;bdrung&gt; +0 on the plus side: he knows the processes and when to talk to people (glibc example); on the downside: the initial ipvsadm SRU patch were not in the minimal needed version, the amount of packages touched outside of netplan are less widespread than what i like to see on a coredev application.&lt;br/&gt;[17:00] &lt;meetingology&gt; +0 on the plus side: he knows the processes and when to talk to people (glibc example); on the downside: the initial ipvsadm SRU patch were not in the minimal needed version, the amount of packages touched outside of netplan are less widespread than what i like to see on a coredev application. received from bdrung&lt;br/&gt;[17:00] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; #endvote&lt;br/&gt;[17:00] &lt;meetingology&gt; Voting ended on: Danilo to get Core Dev rights&lt;br/&gt;[17:00] &lt;meetingology&gt; Votes for: 0, Votes against: 3, Abstentions: 1&lt;br/&gt;[17:00] &lt;meetingology&gt; Motion denied&lt;br/&gt;[17:01] &lt;teward&gt; I am not confident in that you have the requisite understanding of package processes and policies. I also don't see requisite experience in merges, standard SRUs, etc. nor answers to questions asked. I agree with utkarsh2102 that you need to go with the path of MOTU -&gt; Core Dev, or just apply for netplan PPU, and show more experience in SRUs, merges, etc. before we can give you unrestricted upload rights.&lt;br/&gt;[17:01] &lt;teward&gt; unfortunately the vote is not quorate, so we require the vote to be continued to the ML for secondary voting&lt;br/&gt;[17:01] &lt;rbasak&gt; In general the work that you have done seems excellent. Please keep it up!&lt;br/&gt;[17:01] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm not sure you're ready for core dev yet though, which (unfortunately, today) means unsupervised access to upload to the Ubuntu archive.&lt;br/&gt;[17:01] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm concerned that you're missing the overall picture of how Ubuntu delta maintainence works. It appears that if you were left unsupervised uploading +1 fixes then these would build up and languish, and Ubuntu users would find packages in releases that are on old versions because they weren't synced or merged when a sync was available.&lt;br/&gt;[17:01] &lt;rbasak&gt; We can correct this particular understanding right now, but my concern is that all we're doing is a spot check, and similar gaps might also be present in various other aspects of Ubuntu development that we expect core devs to know.&lt;br/&gt;[17:01] &lt;rbasak&gt; We also didn't see evidence of non-trivial merges, and your recent SRU history is mixed, possibly because your non-exception SRU work is fairly thin.&lt;br/&gt;[17:01] &lt;bdrung&gt; I was initially on +1, but I changed it to +0 after seing the -1 to make the vote quorate&lt;br/&gt;[17:01] &lt;rbasak&gt; Unfortunately the necessary discussion there meant that I didn't manage to consider the other aspects I usually look for (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RobieBasak/DMB/CoreDev).&lt;br/&gt;[17:01] &lt;rbasak&gt; For a direct to core dev application I expect a particularly strong application. I'm sorry I don't think that's the case here.&lt;br/&gt;[17:01] &lt;rbasak&gt; Next steps: I don't think there's anything in particular you need to change about what you're doing, except to continuing gaining experience across the archive. What'd I'd like to see in a re-application is a wider and deeper track record of uploads to the main archive component that are more impactful and required deeper review. I appreciate that you're doing this kind of work for netplan already,&lt;br/&gt;[17:02] &lt;rbasak&gt; but for a core dev application, I think it needs to be much wider than this.&lt;br/&gt;[17:02] &lt;teward&gt; bdrung: if you're +0 and the three of us are -1, there's still 3 members who can vote +1 and then it ends in a tie.  So we need to have input from the other DMB members to finalize the vote.&lt;br/&gt;[17:02] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; #action utkarsh2102 to reply to the thread with the conclusion&lt;br/&gt;[17:02] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: utkarsh2102 to reply to the thread with the conclusion&lt;br/&gt;[17:02] &lt;rbasak&gt; teward: I'm not sure about netplan PPU - see the ML thread on "core packages". The question remains open, including on whether netplan would be considered "core" or not. But I don't want to set danilogondolfo up for a netplan PPU only to be blocked by that :-/&lt;br/&gt;[17:02] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; teward: i don't think so, it's never going to be quorate&lt;br/&gt;[17:02] &lt;danilogondolfo&gt; yeah that's cool. I appreciate all the comments&lt;br/&gt;[17:03] &lt;bdrung&gt; teward, no, we would need to reach +1 in sum (but we can only reach +0 if all 3 remaining members would vote +1)&lt;br/&gt;[17:03] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; the max we could get with 3 votes is 0, with -3 right now&lt;br/&gt;[17:03] &lt;teward&gt; rbasak: good point, but I think if they primarily work with netplan and that's their primary focus, that could be an Exception as they're also on Foundations but you're right.&lt;br/&gt;[17:03] &lt;rbasak&gt; teward: I would suggest that in the case of a tie, the motion isn't passed and the status quo would remain.&lt;br/&gt;[17:03] &lt;teward&gt; rbasak: i agree, but that needs defined in our operational spec/docs&lt;br/&gt;[17:04] &lt;teward&gt; operations / procedures *&lt;br/&gt;[17:04] &lt;teward&gt; I desperately need more coffee.  *goes to brew some*&lt;br/&gt;[17:04] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; anyway, anyway, we're at time. I'll close the meeting now formally.&lt;br/&gt;[17:04] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; informal discussions can still happen.&lt;br/&gt;[17:04] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; but i'll wait 10 seconds unless someone has some thing they'd like to speak about&lt;br/&gt;[17:04] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; 5&lt;br/&gt;[17:04] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; 4&lt;br/&gt;[17:04] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; 3&lt;br/&gt;[17:04] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; 2&lt;br/&gt;[17:05] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; 1&lt;br/&gt;[17:05] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; #endvote&lt;br/&gt;[17:05] &lt;meetingology&gt; No vote in progress&lt;br/&gt;[17:05] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; crap :P&lt;br/&gt;[17:05] &lt;danilogondolfo&gt; Thank you all for your time :)&lt;br/&gt;[17:05] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; #endmeeting&lt;br/&gt;[17:05] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting ended at 17:05:09 UTC.

Let's see how it goes than. We can invite guests and otherwise I might run a team-local Foundations/MIR office hours session afterwards&lt;br/&gt;[15:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but let us not do global office hours, but request based - so we know what to expect&lt;br/&gt;[15:01] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ack&lt;br/&gt;[15:01] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; closing ...&lt;br/&gt;[15:01] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #endmeeting&lt;br/&gt;[15:01] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting ended at 15:01:16 UTC.

For openscap itself and the MIR, at this point I think we might reconsider having a snap version of openscap, as it probably won't be backwards compatible.

If I look at the agenda postponing would push this to 2025.

Why wasn't that caught earlier?&lt;br/&gt;[16:37] &lt;gagath&gt; rbasak: I think the problem was that I and the mentor did not a proper build test of this. The mentor uploaded a 0ubuntu2 that fixed the issue after this was sponsored&lt;br/&gt;[16:37] &lt;gagath&gt; my mistake was that I did not use a chroot and tested with a wrong version of pkg-config&lt;br/&gt;[16:38] &lt;gagath&gt; that generated the double /usr&lt;br/&gt;[16:38] &lt;gagath&gt; for the mentor I guess their mistake could be the same&lt;br/&gt;[16:39] &lt;gagath&gt; for 2069963 I forgot to add the version tested in my SRU test message. I confirmed the version tested in a later comment on the bug.&lt;br/&gt;[16:41] &lt;schopin&gt; gagath: you mentioned that you haven't done transitions in Ubuntu yet, but have in Debian. Can you speak of the differences between Debian and Ubuntu on the handling of transitions?&lt;br/&gt;[16:41] &lt;gagath&gt; and for 2073688 I also forgot to explain what I did and with which version. I really need to focus on that. I performed the test according to the test plan but did not add some logs when changing the tags.&lt;br/&gt;[16:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; We don't need logs as such FWIW. Just confirmation of what tests you performed and what version you tested, and the pass result.&lt;br/&gt;[16:42] &lt;gagath&gt; ack&lt;br/&gt;[16:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; Because we have other people who have flipped tags without testing anything because they think the tags need flipping and that's it.&lt;br/&gt;[16:43] &lt;gagath&gt; I see what you are referring to.&lt;br/&gt;[16:43] &lt;rbasak&gt; (and the tests performed need to match the agreed test plan of course)&lt;br/&gt;[16:43] &lt;rbasak&gt; (IOW we believe what you say, but not if you don't say it :-)&lt;br/&gt;[16:44] &lt;gagath&gt; schopin: in Debian I uploaded my packages that depended on each other to unstable, and when everything was in place britney was able to publish them all at once to unstable&lt;br/&gt;[16:45] &lt;gagath&gt; for ubuntu, it would be the same mechanism but using -proposed if the transition is for a stable release&lt;br/&gt;[16:46] &lt;schopin&gt; Not for devel?&lt;br/&gt;[16:47] &lt;gagath&gt; for devel, you would push directly to the devel as there is no -proposed and -updates yet in place (like debian)&lt;br/&gt;[16:47] &lt;gagath&gt; mhm, wiat&lt;br/&gt;[16:48] &lt;gagath&gt; yes. like https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mofed-modules-24.07/+bug/2080904&lt;br/&gt;[16:48] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2080904 in mofed-modules-24.07 (Ubuntu) "autoconf not installed as dependency of mofed-modules-24.07" [Undecided, Fix Released]&lt;br/&gt;[16:48] &lt;gagath&gt; the upload was for oracular and the bug got closed directly without SRU involved.&lt;br/&gt;[16:49] &lt;gagath&gt; (when oracular was devel)&lt;br/&gt;[16:49] &lt;rbasak&gt; gagath: where is the handing of proposed migration documented in Ubuntu, and where would you go to find a list of outstanding blockers for a given package's pending migration?&lt;br/&gt;[16:50] &lt;gagath&gt; https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-maintainers-handbook/blob/main/ProposedMigration.md&lt;br/&gt;[16:50] &lt;gagath&gt; blockers can be found here: https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses.html&lt;br/&gt;[16:51] &lt;gagath&gt; there is a nicer page with a .fr domain name but I sometime struggle to find it and it is... unofficial&lt;br/&gt;[16:51] &lt;schopin&gt; gagath: fwiw, that page is about devel-proposed, which is very much a thing!&lt;br/&gt;[16:51] &lt;gagath&gt; oh&lt;br/&gt;[16:52] &lt;gagath&gt; a&lt;br/&gt;[16:52] &lt;gagath&gt; https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/&lt;br/&gt;[16:53] &lt;gagath&gt; eg https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/noble/update_excuses.html for noble&lt;br/&gt;[16:53] &lt;rbasak&gt; We're running low on time.&lt;br/&gt;[16:53] &lt;rbasak&gt; Is everyone ready to vote?&lt;br/&gt;[16:54] &lt;schopin&gt; I am.&lt;br/&gt;[16:55] &lt;rbasak&gt; #vote Grant gagath core dev&lt;br/&gt;[16:55] &lt;meetingology&gt; Please vote on: Grant gagath core dev&lt;br/&gt;[16:55] &lt;meetingology&gt; Public votes can be registered by saying +1, -1 or +0 in channel (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1|-1|+0 #channelname')&lt;br/&gt;[16:55] &lt;rbasak&gt; -1&lt;br/&gt;[16:55] &lt;meetingology&gt; -1 received from rbasak&lt;br/&gt;[16:55] &lt;rbasak&gt; (reasons to follow)&lt;br/&gt;[16:57] &lt;bdrung&gt; -1&lt;br/&gt;[16:57] &lt;meetingology&gt; -1 received from bdrung&lt;br/&gt;[16:57] &lt;schopin&gt; -1 While I don't doubt gagath's packaging skills, I feel there is a lack of understanding surrounding the Ubuntu processes at large, and in particular on the lifecycle of a package during the development cycle.&lt;br/&gt;[16:57] &lt;meetingology&gt; -1 While I don't doubt gagath's packaging skills, I feel there is a lack of understanding surrounding the Ubuntu processes at large, and in particular on the lifecycle of a package during the development cycle. received from schopin&lt;br/&gt;[16:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; teward: vote?&lt;br/&gt;[16:59] &lt;bdrung&gt; the reason for my vote is the same as what schopin wrote.&lt;br/&gt;[16:59] &lt;schopin&gt; gagath: fwiw, something that helped me a lot to familiar with devel was doing +1 shifts.&lt;br/&gt;[16:59] &lt;gagath&gt; schopin: I wanted to do that, but could not dedicate a full week since the kernel team is already understaffed.&lt;br/&gt;[17:00] &lt;gagath&gt; maybe I can ask again.&lt;br/&gt;[17:00] &lt;rbasak&gt; #endvote&lt;br/&gt;[17:00] &lt;meetingology&gt; Voting ended on: Grant gagath core dev&lt;br/&gt;[17:00] &lt;meetingology&gt; Votes for: 0, Votes against: 3, Abstentions: 0&lt;br/&gt;[17:00] &lt;meetingology&gt; Motion denied&lt;br/&gt;[17:00] &lt;rbasak&gt; More information on my vote:&lt;br/&gt;[17:00] &lt;rbasak&gt; Thank you for your contributions to Ubuntu! I especially value that you are a DD already.&lt;br/&gt;[17:00] &lt;rbasak&gt; Unfortunately I think the Ubuntu-specific expectatiosn we have haven't really been demonstrated. These are important when you are uploading unsupervised, and in particular when others ask you to sponsor for them while under pressure.&lt;br/&gt;[17:00] &lt;rbasak&gt; IMHO (other DMB members differ in opinion on this point), a straight to core dev application needs to be exceptionally strong, but so far, wherever I look, there's some issue. This might be made up by experience or an extensive track record, but I don't see that either in Ubuntu (excluding kernel uploads that have a completely separate process). I appreciate that you have extensive experience in&lt;br/&gt;[17:00] &lt;rbasak&gt; Debian, but the challenge then is to ensure that you understand how Ubuntu differs in process, and know what Ubuntu-specific expectations we have. Unfortunately that cannot be demonstrated by your Debian experience.&lt;br/&gt;[17:00] &lt;rbasak&gt; I have my personal expectations documented here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RobieBasak/DMB/CoreDev&lt;br/&gt;[17:00] &lt;rbasak&gt; I don't think your application really demonstrates meeting my expectations. I'd like to see good examples across the various topics in the penultimate paragraph. I'd also like to see endorsements commensurate with that.&lt;br/&gt;[17:00] &lt;rbasak&gt; Thank you for working towards core dev, and please do continue!

The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy-&gt; We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy-&gt; The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy-&gt; Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy-&gt; During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy-&gt; When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy-&gt; Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...&lt;br/&gt;[20:04] &lt;lucyllewy-&gt; First up (only applicant today) is Oliver Smith ( local_optimum ). Hi, Oliver, can you introduce yourself to the board members and share the links to your application post and your launchpad profile&lt;br/&gt;[20:06] &lt;local_optimum&gt; Fantastic, thank you very much, it's great to be here finally. It was recently my third anniversary of working on Ubuntu at Canonical and I felt it was well overdue to apply after all this time. I've been an Ubuntu user for a while and joined Canonical because it felt like part of my core values to ensure that a private open source operating system should be able to compete in the mainstream space.&lt;br/&gt;[20:07] &lt;local_optimum&gt; I joined as the Product Manager for Ubuntu Desktop, working closely with the engineering teams, expanded my remit to cover Ubuntu Server as well and have since taken over as interim engineering director of the Desktop team. I feel this is a nice endorsement of my engagement with the developers and community to be able to contribute in this way.&lt;br/&gt;[20:07] &lt;local_optimum&gt; My membership application is here: https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/oliver-smith-membership-application/48277&lt;br/&gt;[20:08] &lt;local_optimum&gt; launchpad is here: https://launchpad.net/~local-optimum&lt;br/&gt;[20:08] &lt;local_optimum&gt; happy to dive into detail on any of these items :) hopefully i am not an unfamiliar face&lt;br/&gt;[20:09] &lt;lucyllewy-&gt; awesome. thank you. While the board members review your application and come up with any questions they want to ask I will make sure the question on the Code of Conduct is asked for formalities...&lt;br/&gt;[20:09] &lt;lucyllewy-&gt; You have signed the Code of Conduct. Do you affirm that you have read and understood the whole document, and do you agree to be bound by the terms for the duration of your membership should it be granted?&lt;br/&gt;[20:09] &lt;local_optimum&gt; I have signed it (prior to starting my role in the first place) and agree to be bound by it :)&lt;br/&gt;[20:09] &lt;lucyllewy-&gt; coolbeans.&lt;br/&gt;[20:10] &lt;lucyllewy-&gt; Board members, ask any questions you might have, and let me know when you're ready to vote.&lt;br/&gt;[20:10] &lt;lucyllewy-&gt; I think I am good to go with the information already provided and the glowing testimonials&lt;br/&gt;[20:11] &lt;Wild_Man&gt; Me too, excellent testimonials and work done&lt;br/&gt;[20:12] &lt;mapreri&gt; indeed, today's application looks very well done, full of endorsements as well (those have been getting rare in recent timesâ¦)&lt;br/&gt;[20:13] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; local_optimum: In the event that Canonical employment is terminated, what is your vision to continue contributing to Ubuntu ?&lt;br/&gt;[20:15] &lt;local_optimum&gt; A good question, Ubuntu is a core part of my life and that's not going to change in terms of the ways I use it as a platform for most of my personal projects, I enjoy writing up the work I do and sharing it on my blog as I think there are lack of approachable guides that bring a lot of the different use-cases together. I would certainly hope to continue to be involved in community discussions, I can't&lt;br/&gt;[20:15] &lt;local_optimum&gt; imagine losing touch with the relationships I've built over the last few years. And to be honest I'd probably be able to contribute more code/snaps/applications to the ecosystem as it would certainly free-up some time. I have some v poorly maintained snaps I'd love to go back to.&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;lucyllewy-&gt; that's a good answer &lt;3&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;Kilos&gt; well said&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;lucyllewy-&gt; anyone else have any more questions or are we ready to vote?&lt;br/&gt;[20:17] &lt;mapreri&gt; hear hear indeed.

#topic Any other business?&lt;br/&gt;[14:55] &lt;dviererbe&gt; Would you be interested in migrating the existing MIR documentation to the newer Canonical ReadTheDocs style?&lt;br/&gt;[14:55] &lt;dviererbe&gt; See for example, the SRU documentation (currently also gets migrated): https://canonical-sru-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/&lt;br/&gt;[14:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; nothing from me (too busy to remember)&lt;br/&gt;[14:56] &lt;sarnold&gt; I'd like to kick lenovo-wwan-unlock closer to its resolution if we can&lt;br/&gt;[14:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; dviererbe:  I was indirectly part of the SRU migration and would like that to be the same in general&lt;br/&gt;[14:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; dviererbe: there is a problem i see though&lt;br/&gt;[14:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; dviererbe: this all comes with diataxis which is nice for huge things to split by structure&lt;br/&gt;[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; dviererbe: but this will end up being a doc page looking very lonely with 2x howto (the templates) and 1x reference (the rest)&lt;br/&gt;[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; dviererbe: thereby I feel this isn't a good candidate&lt;br/&gt;[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; dviererbe: happy to be convinced, not against it just not seeing the worth in this case&lt;br/&gt;[14:57] &lt;sarnold&gt; dviererbe: unsure. what we've got now fits our needs nicely and I don't see a huge benefit to moving, beyond making it easier to find if that's a thing with read the docs, but it doeswn't feel like that is&lt;br/&gt;[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; dviererbe: I'd feel more like all (SRU + MIR + AA doce + ...) to converge on one "archive operations" or so&lt;br/&gt;[14:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; dviererbe: is that just an idea of yours or are you driving such with others?&lt;br/&gt;[14:58] &lt;sarnold&gt; diataxising these sounds like a lot of pain for negative gain&lt;br/&gt;[14:58] &lt;dviererbe&gt; It's just an idea from me&lt;br/&gt;[14:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; in this case yes, pain no gain&lt;br/&gt;[14:58] &lt;dviererbe&gt; I see your concers with diataxis&lt;br/&gt;[14:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, so for now the two people speaking up say "maybe better not"&lt;br/&gt;[14:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; my proposal would be the mentioned level up of SRU into archive-operations docs&lt;br/&gt;[14:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; there it will then fit together&lt;br/&gt;[14:59] &lt;dviererbe&gt; my intention was to bring more consistency into our documentation&lt;br/&gt;[14:59] &lt;sarnold&gt; a good goal :)&lt;br/&gt;[14:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ack&lt;br/&gt;[14:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but not at making it worse&lt;br/&gt;[14:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we could write 4x more content, then it would not look awkward&lt;br/&gt;[14:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but what would that be?&lt;br/&gt;[15:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; here is the thing&lt;br/&gt;[15:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; can we make it stay single-page but render in the same style?&lt;br/&gt;[15:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; that would work for this case&lt;br/&gt;[15:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; dviererbe: if you do not happen to know I can ask Sally, but you might already know&lt;br/&gt;[15:00] &lt;dviererbe&gt; I think the idea of a combined SRU/MIR/AA doc is interesting&lt;br/&gt;[15:01] &lt;dviererbe&gt; single page is probably okay for the TA's, but they are instructed to enforce diataxis, so they probably will say no&lt;br/&gt;[15:01] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'll chase that down dviererbe&lt;br/&gt;[15:01] &lt;dviererbe&gt;

This isn't a hard requirement but would be nice to see if you do.&lt;br/&gt;[19:19] &lt;rbasak&gt; Meanwhile, bug 2059197 is a nice example of dealing with a regression - thank you!&lt;br/&gt;[19:19] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2059197 in nfs-utils (Ubuntu Focal) "mount.nfs: Fix minor version parsing when '-t nfs4' and '-o vers=4.x' are used together" [Medium, Fix Released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2059197&lt;br/&gt;[19:20] &lt;mruffell&gt; I believe I have tidied up someones patches for SRU, but it is at most once or twice.... I'm trying to figure out what one it was...&lt;br/&gt;[19:20] &lt;mruffell&gt; but I normally delete superseeded patches from the LP bug to tidy it up to not confuse my sponsors, so finding them is hard&lt;br/&gt;[19:20] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK don't worry&lt;br/&gt;[19:21] &lt;mruffell&gt; and yeah, I do try my best to talk to community users and correct any regressions as fast as possible&lt;br/&gt;[19:21] &lt;rbasak&gt; We don't get many SRU developer applications. I don't have a set of standard questions ready to ask!&lt;br/&gt;[19:22] &lt;bdrung&gt; to avoid needing to clean-up the bug report, you could name the patches $name_v1.patch, $name_v2.patch and so on. then it's clear what is the latest one.&lt;br/&gt;[19:22] &lt;rbasak&gt; From your application and endorsements I agree with ddstreet that you have been ready for a while, and you're well past the line in terms of volume and quality of work.&lt;br/&gt;[19:22] &lt;mruffell&gt; but sometimes v1 is fine for focal, but jammy gets superseeded with a security upload, so jammy has a v2... but then they ask, where's focal v2?&lt;br/&gt;[19:23] &lt;mruffell&gt; So I just try keep everything in lockstep to not be confusing&lt;br/&gt;[19:23] &lt;rbasak&gt; I can't see anything in your recent SRU history that I might want to expand upon by asking questions, so I think I have no questions to ask.&lt;br/&gt;[19:23] &lt;rbasak&gt; Does anyone else have questions or should we move on to vote?&lt;br/&gt;[19:23] &lt;bdrung&gt; it's hard to come up with questions since your work would answer a lot of them (like regression handling, etc)&lt;br/&gt;[19:24] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm not sure a vote can be quorate today but we can make some progress towards that at least.&lt;br/&gt;[19:24] &lt;rbasak&gt; mruffell: not really for your application, but I'd appreciate feedback on the new docs and how you've found them!&lt;br/&gt;[19:24] &lt;mruffell&gt; I have read them! https://canonical-sru-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/&lt;br/&gt;[19:24] &lt;rbasak&gt; If there are no objections I'll start voting now then.&lt;br/&gt;[19:25] &lt;rbasak&gt; #vote Grant mruffell SRU Developer membership&lt;br/&gt;[19:25] &lt;meetingology&gt; Please vote on: Grant mruffell SRU Developer membership&lt;br/&gt;[19:25] &lt;meetingology&gt; Public votes can be registered by saying +1, -1 or +0 in channel (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1|-1|+0 #channelname')&lt;br/&gt;[19:25] &lt;rbasak&gt; +1 comments as above.

There are reduced quorum rules for a second meeting if it becomes necessary&lt;br/&gt;[19:28] &lt;bdrung&gt; rbasak, one comment on https://canonical-sru-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/ - it would be nice to have a one-page version of it (to make searching in it easier)&lt;br/&gt;[19:29] &lt;rbasak&gt; bdrung: is https://canonical-sru-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/ enough?&lt;br/&gt;[19:30] &lt;bdrung&gt; that'll do it as well&lt;br/&gt;[19:30] &lt;rbasak&gt; #topic Ubuntu Core Developer Applications&lt;br/&gt;[19:30] &lt;rbasak&gt; #subtopic Ubuntu Core Developer application by Chris Peterson at DMB meeting 2024-11-25 (I will also join the 2024-09-30 meeting in case there is extra time, pending confirmation if this is ok.)&lt;br/&gt;[19:30] &lt;cpete&gt; Hey there o/&lt;br/&gt;[19:30] &lt;rbasak&gt; cpete: we can see how far we get in the next half hour&lt;br/&gt;[19:31] &lt;rbasak&gt; cpete: but as above a vote today won't be quorate, so you may have to reschedule anyway. Do you want to continue regardless?&lt;br/&gt;[19:31] &lt;cpete&gt; Yeah let's do it please&lt;br/&gt;[19:32] &lt;rbasak&gt; #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/cpete/CoreDev&lt;br/&gt;[19:33] &lt;rbasak&gt; Questions for cpete?&lt;br/&gt;[19:34] &lt;cpete&gt; I suppose I'll introduce myself too. Hi, name is Chris Peterson and I work for Canonical on the Foundations team. I primarily work on Subiquity and other installer related areas. Although as part of my Founations responsibilities I may work in other areas as well.&lt;br/&gt;[19:34] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; (also, hi!!!)&lt;br/&gt;[19:35] &lt;rbasak&gt; Sorry I was preoccupied reading your application. I hadn't realised there was a second one until just earlier. Hello :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:38] &lt;rbasak&gt; cpete: OK I'll start then I guess. If you were considering uploading a new upstream version of a package today, for Oracular, what would you need to check before upload?&lt;br/&gt;[19:40] &lt;cpete&gt; There are various freezes to be aware of, such as featurefreeze, betafreeze etc. For Oracular, you can find the effective dates here: https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/oracular-oriole-release-schedule/36460&lt;br/&gt;[19:41] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; cpete: did you get my question?&lt;br/&gt;[19:41] &lt;cpete&gt; Currently, we are past FeatureFreeze so I wouldn't be considering a new upstream release unless it only contained critical bug fixes necessary for the final release.&lt;br/&gt;[19:41] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK. How does feature freeze apply if the new upstream version is a "microrelease" (eg. 1.2.3 -&gt; 1.2.4)?&lt;br/&gt;[19:41] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; sorry, my client disconnected&lt;br/&gt;[19:42] &lt;cpete&gt; utkarsh2102 no sorry&lt;br/&gt;[19:42] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; q: what if you have package version 1.2.3 in ALL the current stable releases and the current DEVEL release. you're exactly where you are in the cycle as of today. you have notified of a grave bug and you have a patch ready. what versions will you upload and what should you take care before uploading?&lt;br/&gt;[19:42] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; tell me the versions and the precautions for ALL the stable releases and the devel release&lt;br/&gt;[19:42] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; answer once you've answered the current question&lt;br/&gt;[19:43] &lt;cpete&gt; rbasak: version strings aren't the most reliable way to tell what's changed. It's a good indicator, but you'd have to look at the real source changes to be sure if it's a bug fix or not.&lt;br/&gt;[19:43] &lt;rbasak&gt; cpete: OK, thanks.&lt;br/&gt;[19:44] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; rbasak: is it possible for you to paste the scrollback for today's meeting, please?&lt;br/&gt;[19:44] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; https://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2024/09/30/%23ubuntu-meeting.html will take time to sync&lt;br/&gt;[19:45] &lt;rbasak&gt; utkarsh2102: https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/7pttVVttM5/&lt;br/&gt;[19:47] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; thank you!&lt;br/&gt;[19:47] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; cpete: ??&lt;br/&gt;[19:47] &lt;cpete&gt; utkarsh2102:  The new version would be 1.2.3-0ubuntu1. I would be first uploading to devel, and I would need to then prepare SRUs for applying the patch to previous versions. SRU version strings can be hard, I'd need a second to double check the guidance on that. I imagine in this case 1.2.3-0ubuntu1 would be fine, but all of my SRUs have already had the version numbers handy :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:48] &lt;cpete&gt; utkarsh2102:  taking "grave" to mean critical but maybe not a security bug&lt;br/&gt;[19:48] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; yes, a regular bug&lt;br/&gt;[19:49] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; cpete: will you directly upload to devel? no precautions?&lt;br/&gt;[19:49] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; cpete: so 1.2.3-0ubuntu1 will work for what all releases, please name them?&lt;br/&gt;[19:50] &lt;cpete&gt; utkarsh2102: ah certainly not. I would first build and test the new version locally and make sure autopkgtests pass. (I have done this so far with the majority of my uploads with PPA builds to demonstrate this to my sponsors)&lt;br/&gt;[19:53] &lt;cpete&gt; utkarsh2102: Well it will certainly work for devel. The SRU version string is important that's greater than any version in any of that releases pockets e.g. jammy jammy-updates, jammy-security. Since you say that's the version in all releases that should be fine as well. But we'd have to check each release&lt;br/&gt;[19:54] &lt;cpete&gt; jammy-release jammy-updats jammy-security&lt;br/&gt;[19:55] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; cpete: I had added "you're exactly where you are in the cycle as of today." - which applies to devel. what do you think you should do more, if anything?&lt;br/&gt;[19:55] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; cpete: 1.2.3 is the highest version in noble, jammy, focal&lt;br/&gt;[19:55] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; i don't think you really have to go through each pocket of the release to check :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:56] &lt;rbasak&gt; We're nearly out of time&lt;br/&gt;[19:56] &lt;cpete&gt; Ah well I would probably contact a release team member and make them aware of the bug.&lt;br/&gt;[19:56] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; cpete: "The SRU version string is important that's greater than any version in any of that releases pockets" why?&lt;br/&gt;[19:57] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; rbasak: I can vote on mruffell's application now and make it quorate, right?&lt;br/&gt;[19:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; utkarsh2102: yes&lt;br/&gt;[19:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; (if you vote +1)&lt;br/&gt;[19:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; A -1 wouldn't be quorate&lt;br/&gt;[19:57] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; ok, +1 for mruffell!!!&lt;br/&gt;[19:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; Congrats mruffell :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:57] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; yay!&lt;br/&gt;[19:57] &lt;mruffell&gt; Thanks! I'm very happy&lt;br/&gt;[19:57] &lt;bdrung&gt; congrats!&lt;br/&gt;[19:58] &lt;rbasak&gt; I had further questions too, so I think we'll need to postpone. Sorry cpete&lt;br/&gt;[19:58] &lt;mruffell&gt; I can finally retry autopkgtests now without bothering m-f-o or h-a-l-v-e-s =p&lt;br/&gt;[19:58] &lt;cpete&gt; utkarsh2102: so they get the new version of the package when updating it&lt;br/&gt;[19:58] &lt;cpete&gt; rbasak: no worries, thanks for the time everyone&lt;br/&gt;[19:58] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; right, so what about f -&gt; j upgrades?&lt;br/&gt;[19:58] &lt;rbasak&gt; If anybody would like to continue, feel free and I'll check the logs later&lt;br/&gt;[19:58] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; and j - n ?&lt;br/&gt;[19:58] &lt;rbasak&gt; I think that might be utkarsh2102 volunteering :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:58] &lt;rbasak&gt; #chair utkarsh2102&lt;br/&gt;[19:59] &lt;meetingology&gt; Current chairs: rbasak, utkarsh2102&lt;br/&gt;[19:59] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; rbasak: i don't think we should half half applications&lt;br/&gt;[19:59] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; that is so sub-optimal&lt;br/&gt;[19:59] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; #chair bdrung&lt;br/&gt;[19:59] &lt;rbasak&gt; utkarsh2102: fair. Do you want to continue with this line of questions then?&lt;br/&gt;[19:59] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; also&lt;br/&gt;[19:59] &lt;meetingology&gt; Current chairs: bdrung, rbasak, utkarsh2102&lt;br/&gt;[19:59] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; rbasak: yes, I can. bdrung, are you around for a bit more?&lt;br/&gt;[20:00] &lt;bdrung&gt; yes&lt;br/&gt;[20:00] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; are you okay to continue then?&lt;br/&gt;[20:00] &lt;bdrung&gt; yes&lt;br/&gt;[20:00] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; perf!&lt;br/&gt;[20:00] &lt;rbasak&gt; utkarsh2102: afterwards, please switch to an AOB topic and assign the two necessary actions for mruffell's application, to keep the automatic minutes straight&lt;br/&gt;[20:00] &lt;rbasak&gt; o/&lt;br/&gt;[20:00] &lt;mfo&gt; congrats, mruffell! o/ (3-min delayed)&lt;br/&gt;[20:00] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; rbasak: will do, thanks! o/&lt;br/&gt;[20:01] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; cpete: waiting on you to answer my question currently&lt;br/&gt;[20:01] &lt;teward&gt; *waves*&lt;br/&gt;[20:01]  * bdrung grabs some snacks to be able to continue&lt;br/&gt;[20:01] &lt;teward&gt; i'm still here but my internet's fuzzy because Verizon is having some internet problems right now on cell service&lt;br/&gt;[20:01] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; great, thanks teward&lt;br/&gt;[20:01] &lt;teward&gt; #chair teward&lt;br/&gt;[20:01] &lt;meetingology&gt; Current chairs: bdrung, rbasak, teward, utkarsh2102&lt;br/&gt;[20:01] &lt;cpete&gt; utkarsh2102: Ah right, we don't want users to upgrade and regress. This is why it's important to SRU to each release, and each version string is usually release specific&lt;br/&gt;[20:02] &lt;teward&gt; *knows too much about meetingology*&lt;br/&gt;[20:02] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; lmao&lt;br/&gt;[20:02] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; cpete: okay, soooo?&lt;br/&gt;[20:02] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; wdym by "upgrade and regress"?&lt;br/&gt;[20:04] &lt;cpete&gt; utkarsh2102: So if 1.2.3 is the highest version in each release, then 1.2.3-0ubuntu1 is probably fine for each version you would just need to SRU it back to each. By "upgrade and regress" we don't want users to upgrade to a newer version of ubuntu and reintroduce bugs. This is why we make sure to land patches in devel before SRUing them.&lt;br/&gt;[20:04] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; got it&lt;br/&gt;[20:05] &lt;mruffell&gt; cpete: have you done an SRU before?&lt;br/&gt;[20:05] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; last question around this: when you update to 1.2.3-0ubuntu1 to focal, jammy, and noble. does this cause any problem?&lt;br/&gt;[20:05] &lt;cpete&gt; mruffell: I have done 3 yes. Here is one example for livecd-rootfs https://bugs.launchpad.net/subiquity/+bug/1974483&lt;br/&gt;[20:05] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 1974483 in subiquity "autoinstall ssh:install-server:false is misleading in 22.04" [High, Fix Released]&lt;br/&gt;[20:07] &lt;cpete&gt; utkarsh2102: I'm not sure I understand the question&lt;br/&gt;[20:08] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; cpete: per your last answer above - you said "1.2.3-0ubuntu1 is probably fine for each version [...]"&lt;br/&gt;[20:08] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; so when you've done that&lt;br/&gt;[20:09] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; and let's say focal, jammy, noble is at "1.2.3-0ubuntu1" - does  everything work fine? and can we call the bug closed? or is there something we should still do? or?&lt;br/&gt;[20:11] &lt;cpete&gt; utkarsh2102: we could only close the bug after SRU verification. It will then phase from -proposed to -updates and as long as no errors are reported it will fully phase and we could call it done. If that's what you're getting at.&lt;br/&gt;[20:12] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; ok, i'll move on, thank you :)&lt;br/&gt;[20:12] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; cpete: I was trying to get at the upgrade story from focal -&gt; jammy; jammy -&gt; noble.&lt;br/&gt;[20:13] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; cpete: q: what happens when you upload a package to the devel release. where does it go? is there any other step you need to take care as an uploader?&lt;br/&gt;[20:15] &lt;cpete&gt; utkarsh2102: It will land in -proposed and await migration until the package's and its rev-dpes autopkgtests pass. The uploader is responsible for seeing the package migrate into -release. This is setting aside times from freezes, say beta freeze, where the upload may require additional approval in the queue before landing into -proposed.&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; mruffell: hey, btw, i've added you to the right ACL and announced your application already!!! o/&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; cpete: thanks, what if all autopkgtests pass and yet the package doesn't migrate?&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;mruffell&gt; utkarsh2102: thanks, I got the ACL email and the announcement =)&lt;br/&gt;[20:17] &lt;bdrung&gt; cpete, Imagine a user detects a bug in droopy in jammy and provides a patch. You want to sponsor the fix. What would you upload (version numbers and releases)?&lt;br/&gt;[20:18] &lt;cpete&gt; utkarsh2102: there may be other reasons for the package not migrating. update_excuses output is helpful here&lt;br/&gt;[20:18] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; cpete: suppose there's nothing in update_excuses, all autopkgtests pass, yet the package doesn't migrate&lt;br/&gt;[20:18] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; what next?&lt;br/&gt;[20:21] &lt;cpete&gt; utkarsh2102: hmmm reasons for this scenario don't immediately come to mind. (is there a block-proposed tag for devel series?) I would probably head over to ubuntu-devel or ubuntu-release and ask&lt;br/&gt;[20:21] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; no tags, that'd show up in update_excuses&lt;br/&gt;[20:22] &lt;cpete&gt; utkarsh2102: and if it were waiting for another package to migrate it would show up there too. So I don't know here&lt;br/&gt;[20:22] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; got it, thanks o/&lt;br/&gt;[20:23] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; i was trying to get at uninstallability issues :)&lt;br/&gt;[20:23] &lt;cpete&gt; Ah, I feeel like I usually see those in autopkgtest before they dissapear from update_excuses&lt;br/&gt;[20:24] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; update_output tells you about them! :)&lt;br/&gt;[20:24] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; update_output.txt&lt;br/&gt;[20:24] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; cpete: i'll let you answer bdrung's question next&lt;br/&gt;[20:24] &lt;cpete&gt; Ahh. Another useful tool of the ubuntu archive toolbox&lt;br/&gt;[20:24] &lt;bdrung&gt; cpete, Imagine a user detects a bug in droopy in jammy and provides a patch. You want to sponsor the fix. What would you upload (version numbers and releases) in case you are a core-dev?&lt;br/&gt;[20:27] &lt;cpete&gt; bdrung: sorry for the delay. Looking at droopy. I see that for Jammy, Noble, and Oracular are all the same version. I would first upload their patch to oracular-devel as 0.20160830-5ubuntu1&lt;br/&gt;[20:27] &lt;bdrung&gt; good and then?&lt;br/&gt;[20:29] &lt;cpete&gt; Considering all is well and they have SRU templates for Noble and Jammy, I would upload 0.20160830-5ubuntu1 to Jammy and Noble.

For example, for https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-3597 the security advisory notes the "4.4.0-6ubuntu1" version as the fix version in Ubuntu lunar, and "4.4.0-4ubuntu3.1" as the fix version for Ubuntu kinetic. However, https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/lunar/amd64/libtiff5-dev/4.4.0-4ubuntu3.1 lists that the&lt;br/&gt;[16:11] -ubottu:#ubuntu-security- LibTIFF 4.4.0 has an out-of-bounds write in _TIFFmemcpy in libtiff/tif_unix.c:346 when called from extractImageSection, tools/tiffcrop.c:6826, allowing attackers to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file. For users that compile libtiff from sources, the fix is available with commit 236b7191. &lt;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-3597&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[16:11] &lt;laki&gt; "4.4.0-4ubuntu3.1" version was released in Ubuntu lunar. Does that mean that for Ubuntu lunar the version "4.4.0-4ubuntu3.1" is vulnerable to the CVE, while for ubuntu kinetic the same version fixes the vulnerability?&lt;br/&gt;[16:11] &lt;laki&gt; Also, more generalized - does it ever occur that the same source package version can be considered vulnerable on one distro version, but not the other? If so, can you provide any examples?&lt;br/&gt;[16:16] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; the 4.4.0-4ubuntu3.1 package never made it's way out of lunar-proposed, so it was never actually in lunar before it got replaced https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tiff/+publishinghistory?batch=75&amp;memo=75&amp;start=75&lt;br/&gt;[16:16] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; laki: different distros build software with different build options and different patches, it's quite possible a vulnerability affets one distro but not another for the same version&lt;br/&gt;[16:20] &lt;laki&gt; Thank you. So I should disregard the Proposed pocket, understood. I can ask the same thing regarding CVE-2023-4693. Here, it notes that for noble the 1.199 version is the fix version, while for mantic the version 1.197 is the fix version. However, from what I can tell, the version 1.197 was released in noble in the Release pocket. Does that mean that 1.197 is vulnerable on noble, but not&lt;br/&gt;[16:20] -ubottu:#ubuntu-security- An out-of-bounds read flaw was found on grub2's NTFS filesystem driver. This issue may allow a physically present attacker to present a specially crafted NTFS file system image to read arbitrary memory locations. A successful attack allows sensitive data cached in memory or EFI variable values to be leaked, presenting a high Confidentiality risk. &lt;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-4693&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[16:20] &lt;laki&gt; on mantic?&lt;br/&gt;[16:21] &lt;laki&gt; I'm sorry for the barrage of questions, but I'm trying to understand how it all fits together. But yeah, it's what I assumed regarding build options, and different linked libraries which might make the vulnerability a non-issue. However, can one source package version contain different patches on different distro releases? I assumed not?&lt;br/&gt;[16:27] &lt;laki&gt; Also, from the top off your head, do you perchance have an example of a vulnerability which was not applicable on one distro, but not the other, for the same version?&lt;br/&gt;=== Juesto is now known as Juest&lt;br/&gt;[18:43] &lt;Habbie&gt; somewhat hope i'm not the first to post this here - https://xcancel.com/evilsocket/status/1839361276813902240&lt;br/&gt;[18:44] &lt;Habbie&gt; instead of 30 sept to distros@openwall and 6 oct public, he's going all out in 75 minutes with the announced 'CVSS 9.9 RCE in a lot of systems'&lt;br/&gt;[18:53] &lt;sbeattie&gt; Habbie: thanks, we are aware.&lt;br/&gt;[18:53] &lt;Habbie&gt; good. i knew you were aware of things before this tweet, to be clear :)&lt;br/&gt;[18:54] &lt;sbeattie&gt; Yeah, to be explicit, we are aware of the CRD change.&lt;br/&gt;[18:54] &lt;Habbie&gt; CR..

if you do the opposite it would shutdown and the printer would never get created?&lt;br/&gt;[23:18] &lt;JanC&gt; that's where the "launch when needed" comes into play   :)&lt;br/&gt;[23:18] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; ah, except how do you know when you need it?&lt;br/&gt;[23:19] &lt;JanC&gt; like, when you open a print dialog or the printer setup panel &lt;br/&gt;[23:19] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; yeah, so if we do that, might as well just use the cups api to do that and bypass the browse daemon entirely&lt;br/&gt;[23:20] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; I guess it might be simpler *shrug*&lt;br/&gt;[23:20] &lt;JanC&gt; well, sounds like triggering it at that point might be easier, but dunno&lt;br/&gt;[23:20] &lt;JanC&gt; at least as a temporary thing until it's fixed properly&lt;br/&gt;[23:21] &lt;JanC&gt; and/or to fix custom print dialogs  :)&lt;br/&gt;[23:23] &lt;JanC&gt; maybe browsed shouldn't be running as root also...&lt;br/&gt;[23:24] &lt;JanC&gt; all of cups really&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;# UBUNTU-MEETING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;adrien&gt; \o&lt;br/&gt;[14:57] &lt;Skia&gt; o7&lt;br/&gt;[14:59] &lt;upils&gt; o/&lt;br/&gt;[14:59] &lt;uralt&gt; o/&lt;br/&gt;[14:59] &lt;ravikant_&gt; o/&lt;br/&gt;[14:59] &lt;liushuyu&gt; o/&lt;br/&gt;[14:59] &lt;andersson123&gt; o/&lt;br/&gt;[15:00] &lt;mkukri&gt; o/&lt;br/&gt;[15:00] &lt;dbungert&gt; o/&lt;br/&gt;[15:00] &lt;mateus-morais&gt; o/&lt;br/&gt;[15:01] &lt;ginggs&gt; o/&lt;br/&gt;[15:02] &lt;zhsj&gt; o/&lt;br/&gt;[15:02] &lt;tobhe&gt; o/&lt;br/&gt;[15:02] &lt;dbungert&gt; #startmeeting Weekly Ubuntu Foundations team&lt;br/&gt;[15:02] &lt;xypron&gt; \o&lt;br/&gt;[15:02] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting started at 15:02:26 UTC.

I guess that's true for "normal" packages. But "Demoting libglib2.0-dev isn't easy because it's a low level libraries that most other desktop dev libraries depends on." So the desktop team would need to maintain a long-tail of -dev exclusions&lt;br/&gt;[14:48] &lt;slyon&gt; or get their -dev dependencies included in "main"&lt;br/&gt;[14:48] &lt;slyon&gt; correct cpaelzer&lt;br/&gt;[14:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; If other things "really" depend on it (not just the auto-inclusion), then yes it should stay in main IMHO&lt;br/&gt;[14:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; about the issue of maintaining long tails&lt;br/&gt;[14:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we faced similar issues in server when some packages had too much content in a few packages&lt;br/&gt;[14:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; like 50 plugins of which only 2 really were prime time&lt;br/&gt;[14:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; there we ended up splitting the package&lt;br/&gt;[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and the one that stayed in main has much more reasonable dependencies than the former huge super-package&lt;br/&gt;[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I do not know the libglib2.0-dev situation, but could something like that help there too?&lt;br/&gt;[14:50] &lt;didrocks&gt; cpaelzer: smell like a similar story than gstreamer plugins :)&lt;br/&gt;[14:50] &lt;slyon&gt; I need to check the germinate output to see what exactly is pulling in libglib2.0-dev.&lt;br/&gt;[14:51] &lt;didrocks&gt; slyon: Iâm afraid you will end up with a long list of -dev packages depending on libglib2.0-dev&lt;br/&gt;[14:51] &lt;didrocks&gt; gtk being one, for instance&lt;br/&gt;[14:51] &lt;slyon&gt; But do I understand correctly, that you suggest instead of doing the MIR for a new build-tool dependency we should rather work with Extra-Excludes?&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the one that is accoutned for in germinate is libaccountsservice-dev  , but there might be more than that as didrocks says&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;didrocks&gt; yeah, germinate will only points to the "first" one that it founds IIRC&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; correct&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;didrocks&gt; you "fix" it, then goes to the nextâ¦&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;slyon&gt; right.&lt;br/&gt;[14:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: If that -dev package has no deep purpose or reason on it's own to be in main - AND only is in for auto-include. Then an auto-exclude is ok AFAIK&lt;br/&gt;[14:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; there are -dev which contain tools that are needed, others are actually always linked in so they are actually active code, ... - these would not qualify&lt;br/&gt;[14:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but if it really is a normal -dev mostly having headers but not more&lt;br/&gt;[14:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; then an exclude if it causes pain might be ok&lt;br/&gt;[14:54] &lt;didrocks&gt; and agreed&lt;br/&gt;[14:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but one would need to work back the chain e.g. the aforementioned libaccountsservice-dev&lt;br/&gt;[14:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and add them all&lt;br/&gt;[14:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ensuring that NONE of them has a deeper purpose&lt;br/&gt;[14:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; -doc is a similar story BTW&lt;br/&gt;[14:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; often pulling in weird tools to build yet another special markdown language&lt;br/&gt;[14:55] &lt;didrocks&gt; another approach is to patch so that architectures-properties can be downgraded to a suggests&lt;br/&gt;[14:55] &lt;slyon&gt; Yes... https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/architecture-properties/+bug/2080965 might have a deeper purpose potentially, it provides the "architecture-is-64bit" or "architecture-is-big-endian" meta packages. but OTOH we didn't need it in main up to now&lt;br/&gt;[14:55] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2080965 in architecture-properties (Ubuntu) "[MIR] architecture-properties" [Low, Incomplete]&lt;br/&gt;[14:55] &lt;didrocks&gt; as itâs "only" for cross-arch builds from what you discussed?&lt;br/&gt;[14:55] &lt;jbicha&gt; https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/ubuntu-seeds/+git/ubuntu/commit/?id=4c41750b is an approximation of the number of excludes you would need&lt;br/&gt;[14:55] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Commit 4c41750 in ~ubuntu-core-dev/ubuntu-seeds/+git/ubuntu "Extra-Exclude: drop the sysprof exclusions"&lt;br/&gt;[14:56] &lt;slyon&gt; it also provides a wrapper around qemu-user to execute cross-architecture tests for example&lt;br/&gt;[14:56] &lt;jbicha&gt; it's incomplete because it would take me a few rounds with an archive admin to ensure we got everything&lt;br/&gt;[14:56] &lt;sarnold&gt; the "Build-Dependencies not necessarily in main" thing was kinda intended to help us keep sphinx and the like from getting messy&lt;br/&gt;[14:58] &lt;slyon&gt; Okay. ovearll it seems like there's no consensus for changing the defaults to exclude -dev packages.

Basically during Beta we had trouble getting in touch with the main flavor lead, but indeed the rest of listed people were able to act on the flavor&lt;br/&gt;[19:13] &lt;sil2100&gt; Okay, so it is the fact of 'too many contacts'. The list doesn't include 10 people though, just 4 through name&lt;br/&gt;[19:13] &lt;sil2100&gt; And I think mentioning 'members of ubuntucinnamon-dev' is a natural thing to say?&lt;br/&gt;[19:14] &lt;sil2100&gt; But okay, let's carry over my item. What I'll do is send a message to Cinnamon asking them about current contact information&lt;br/&gt;[19:14] &lt;sil2100&gt; And making sure that all the contacts that are listed can action on the actual flavor&lt;br/&gt;[19:14] &lt;amurray&gt; thanks sil2100&lt;br/&gt;[19:14] &lt;sil2100&gt; And can be made accountable&lt;br/&gt;[19:14] &lt;sil2100&gt; Thank you for the context o/&lt;br/&gt;[19:14] &lt;seb128&gt; it seems reasonable to me as well, I'm unsure to understand the original concern, maybe just dropping the reference to the team would be enough?&lt;br/&gt;[19:15] &lt;seb128&gt; thanks!&lt;br/&gt;[19:15] &lt;amurray&gt; #action sil2100 to follow up on the Cinnamon 24.04 LTS Qualification to ensure the listed contacts can action the flavor&lt;br/&gt;[19:15] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: sil2100 to follow up on the Cinnamon 24.04 LTS Qualification to ensure the listed contacts can action the flavor&lt;br/&gt;[19:15] &lt;amurray&gt; ACTION: rbasak to document the third party software sources policy somewhere appropriate&lt;br/&gt;[19:16] &lt;rbasak&gt; o/&lt;br/&gt;[19:16] &lt;rbasak&gt; I created https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-governance-docs&lt;br/&gt;[19:16] &lt;rbasak&gt; Getting some help from a technical author within Canonical for the infrastructure pieces&lt;br/&gt;[19:16] &lt;rbasak&gt; But this is still in progress&lt;br/&gt;[19:16] &lt;rbasak&gt; Please carry over&lt;br/&gt;[19:16] &lt;sil2100&gt; \o/&lt;br/&gt;[19:16] &lt;amurray&gt; nice - thanks rbasak&lt;br/&gt;[19:17] &lt;amurray&gt; #action rbasak to document the third party software sources policy somewhere appropriate&lt;br/&gt;[19:17] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: rbasak to document the third party software sources policy somewhere appropriate&lt;br/&gt;[19:17] &lt;amurray&gt; #topic Scan the mailing list archive for anything we missed (standing item)&lt;br/&gt;[19:17] &lt;amurray&gt; #link https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2024-September/thread.html&lt;br/&gt;[19:17] &lt;amurray&gt; nothing there&lt;br/&gt;[19:17] &lt;amurray&gt; #topic Check up on community bugs and techboard bugs&lt;br/&gt;[19:17] &lt;amurray&gt; #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-community/+bugs?field.assignee=techboard&lt;br/&gt;[19:18] &lt;amurray&gt; #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/techboard&lt;br/&gt;[19:18] &lt;amurray&gt; LP: #2015920 can probably be closed out soon rbasak&lt;br/&gt;[19:18] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2015920 in techboard "Third party repository policy is not well defined" [Undecided, Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2015920&lt;br/&gt;[19:19] &lt;rbasak&gt; Agreed.

Can you maybe add a comment to the LP bug and set it to "Incomplete", so we can bringt it up next time and the package owners have time to react to that comment in the meantime?&lt;br/&gt;[14:57] &lt;slyon&gt; Oh there is a comment already&lt;br/&gt;[14:58] &lt;slyon&gt; And they seem to be fine.

Only inactive members will reduce the quorum requirement. "Any DMB member who fails to attend 6 consecutive scheduled DMB meetings (during a period no shorter than 12 weeks) shall be considered inactive"&lt;br/&gt;[16:20] &lt;rbasak&gt; Oh, OK&lt;br/&gt;[16:21] &lt;rbasak&gt; "at the next scheduled meeting, the vote will pass with only a majority of present members"&lt;br/&gt;[16:21] &lt;rbasak&gt; That's not my reading though?&lt;br/&gt;[16:21] &lt;bdrung&gt; But we should hold the meeting anyway. E.g. if we vote +3 in total, we would just need one more member to vote +1 on the ML to get the application approved.&lt;br/&gt;[16:21] &lt;rbasak&gt; Yes we should proceed anyway&lt;br/&gt;[16:22] &lt;bdrung&gt; Oh, I missed the part. So we need to vote this time and won't reach quorum. Then we can vote next time with just the majority of present members.&lt;br/&gt;[16:23] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[16:23] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; I think we should really start&lt;br/&gt;[16:24] &lt;bdrung&gt; Who wants to chair.

And if it's after feature freeze, Oracular has 2.34.0-0ubuntu2 and s390x-tools upstream release 2.34.1, what do you need to check to verify that an upload to Oracular will not violate feature freeze?&lt;br/&gt;[16:33] &lt;fheimes&gt; today was beta and hwe freeze&lt;br/&gt;[16:34] &lt;fheimes&gt; well, there are several things (I guess)&lt;br/&gt;[16:34] &lt;fheimes&gt; one thing to check is if the new release is a bug fix release only&lt;br/&gt;[16:35] &lt;fheimes&gt; (there is a high chance with a x.y.1)&lt;br/&gt;[16:35] &lt;fheimes&gt; if it incl. new features, that are urgently needed and it would violate the FF, then a FFe can be thought of&lt;br/&gt;[16:36] &lt;fheimes&gt; if a new version incl. new features AND bug fixes and some fixes are needed, then they need to be cherry-picked -- the package can no longer be simply version bumped after the FF&lt;br/&gt;[16:37] &lt;fheimes&gt; I hope I covered what you were looking for?&lt;br/&gt;[16:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; Yes thanks. Typing question next question...&lt;br/&gt;[16:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; If you upload and it gets "stuck in proposed", who is expected to resolve the situation?&lt;br/&gt;[16:38] &lt;fheimes&gt; well, it's primarily me&lt;br/&gt;[16:39] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK. And how would you approach that - for example where's the documentation for dealing with this situation?&lt;br/&gt;[16:39] &lt;fheimes&gt; I'll should check and shepared the package through the process and should see when it gets stuck, but I will also get a notification in case it's stuck for a certain amount of time&lt;br/&gt;[16:40] &lt;fheimes&gt; I would first of all look at launchpad, trying to find out why it's stuck (FTBFS, missing approval)&lt;br/&gt;[16:41] &lt;fheimes&gt; britney is another source, actually the update excuses page, like:&lt;br/&gt;[16:41] &lt;fheimes&gt; https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/oracular/update_excuses.html#s390-tools&lt;br/&gt;[16:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; Do you get dep8 results for s390-tools in practice?&lt;br/&gt;[16:42] &lt;fheimes&gt; there are many docs where someone can find more info on what to do, for example in case of an SRU: https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/pending-sru.html&lt;br/&gt;[16:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; I see the packaging doesn't ship tests (I think?) but maybe you get rdep dep8 tests triggered?&lt;br/&gt;[16:43] &lt;fheimes&gt; @rbasak: the status on that is what I can see here: https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/oracular/update_excuses.html#s390-tools&lt;br/&gt;[16:44] &lt;rbasak&gt; There's nothing there at the moment though because it isn't pending migration right now&lt;br/&gt;[16:44] &lt;fheimes&gt; and I can often find directly the reason there (failt to build, missing approval etc)&lt;br/&gt;[16:44] &lt;fheimes&gt; yes, that's correct atm there is nothing there (was just an example in case its stuck)&lt;br/&gt;[16:44] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; question: what if it's not there (update_excuses.html) and the package has still not migrated?&lt;br/&gt;[16:45] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; where will you look?&lt;br/&gt;[16:45] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; or what will you do?&lt;br/&gt;[16:45] &lt;fheimes&gt; and failed tests of dependent packages can be identified and if needed, retriggered (in different ways) or tests fixed (if needed)&lt;br/&gt;[16:46] &lt;fheimes&gt; this is a good doc on this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ProposedMigration#How_to_re-run_autopkgtests_with_dependencies_on_other_packages_in_the_proposed_pocket that I sometimes refer to&lt;br/&gt;[16:47] &lt;rbasak&gt; Thanks.

Is there any particular reason why it has to be limited to snaps?&lt;br/&gt;[04:07] &lt;amurray&gt; blahdeblah: currently the implementation in prompting-client is quite snap specific and it would need a bunch of work to make it applicable to general applications - but the AppArmor prompting feature itself in the kernel is generic, and supports multiple prompt listeners&lt;br/&gt;[04:08] &lt;amurray&gt; so it is possible to write a separate client that deals with non-snap applications via prompting&lt;br/&gt;[04:12] &lt;blahdeblah&gt; But no plans for that at the moment, I take it?&lt;br/&gt;[07:50] &lt;amurray&gt; blahdeblah: not that I know of unfortunately - but I will raise it internally and let you know if we can get any buy-in&lt;br/&gt;[07:51] &lt;blahdeblah&gt; amurray: &lt;3&lt;br/&gt;[07:57] &lt;mcphail&gt; Does the prompter work in the terminal for command line snaps?&lt;br/&gt;[10:13] &lt;amurray&gt; mcphail: no - and I am wondering how that might possibly work.. I guess if the shell itself was somehow tied in to listen for prompts it could do that but otherwise given a terminal only has a single input I think this would be a pretty challenging UX&lt;br/&gt;[11:52] &lt;mcphail&gt; amurray: I suppose I was thinking of something like how apt uses `dialog`, which degrades to a TUI if there's no graphical interface. But that would probably require all snaps to run in another wrapper layer, I'd guess?&lt;br/&gt;[19:28] &lt;ahasenack&gt; hi apparmor experts,&lt;br/&gt;[19:28] &lt;ahasenack&gt; what is the operation being attempted that is triggering this log?&lt;br/&gt;[19:28] &lt;ahasenack&gt; [Tue Sep 10 19:25:27 2024] audit: type=1400 audit(1725996325.250:4072): apparmor="ALLOWED" operation="capable" class="cap" namespace="root//lxd-x-uat-apparmor_&lt;var-snap-lxd-common-lxd&gt;" profile="ubuntu_pro_apt_news" pid=314582 comm="python3" capability=5  capname="kill"&lt;br/&gt;[19:28] &lt;ahasenack&gt; i.e., what is the call?&lt;br/&gt;[19:28] &lt;ahasenack&gt; "capable"&lt;br/&gt;[19:28] &lt;ahasenack&gt; I'm trying to find out where in the code this is happening&lt;br/&gt;[19:29] &lt;sbeattie&gt; CAP_KILL (from  capability=5  capname="kill")&lt;br/&gt;[19:29] &lt;ahasenack&gt; how would I see this in strace, for example?&lt;br/&gt;[19:30] &lt;georgiag&gt; unfortunately several syscalls can do several capability checks so it's hard to pinpoint exactly &lt;br/&gt;[19:30] &lt;georgiag&gt; but I assume a syscall would return -EACCESS in strace&lt;br/&gt;[19:30] &lt;ahasenack&gt; problem is how to run strace on a confined app :))&lt;br/&gt;[19:31] &lt;ahasenack&gt; this is somewhere inside apt,&lt;br/&gt;[19:31] &lt;georgiag&gt; -EACCES better yet&lt;br/&gt;[19:31] &lt;rlee287&gt; Maybe use some kind of systemwide BPF tool instead?

Thanks!&lt;br/&gt;[14:49] &lt;didrocks&gt; will add them to my promotion basket :)&lt;br/&gt;[14:56] &lt;slyon&gt; didrocks: while you're on it, one more which has become ready: bug #2078827&lt;br/&gt;[14:56] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2078827 in luit (Ubuntu) "[MIR] luit" [Undecided, Fix Committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2078827&lt;br/&gt;[14:56] &lt;slyon&gt; And I've pinged the QA team to put their team bug-subscriber on retry (LP: #2076381) which would make that ready for promotion as well.&lt;br/&gt;[14:56] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2076381 in retry (Ubuntu) "[MIR] retry" [Undecided, Fix Committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2076381&lt;br/&gt;[14:59] &lt;didrocks&gt; itâs almost christmas! :)&lt;br/&gt;[15:10] &lt;didrocks&gt; slyon: jbicha: ok, so libpanel, libdex and luit promoted. I hold on on retry until it gets a team subscription&lt;br/&gt;[15:29] &lt;Skia&gt; didrocks: just so you know, we just discovered that we don't have any admin anymore in that team, which means nobody is currently able to subscribe the team. We're trying to get this sorted asap :-)&lt;br/&gt;[16:13] &lt;didrocks&gt; Skia: urgh, good luck!&lt;br/&gt;[16:14] &lt;Skia&gt; nah, it's fine, it's already fixed, now we're just waiting on ravikant_ to subscribe the team :-)&lt;br/&gt;[16:20] &lt;didrocks&gt; ack!&lt;br/&gt;[16:20] &lt;didrocks&gt; Iâll have a look tomorrow morning at the bug if things changed :)&lt;br/&gt;[16:26] &lt;Skia&gt; thanks :-)&lt;br/&gt;[18:59]  * vorlon waves&lt;br/&gt;[19:00] &lt;rbasak&gt; o/&lt;br/&gt;[19:00] &lt;rbasak&gt; There are some items still on the agenda that I think are resolved wrt. the third party repo requirements work.&lt;br/&gt;[19:01] &lt;seb128&gt; hey&lt;br/&gt;[19:01] &lt;rbasak&gt; Since we ratified the draft in a recent meeting, I think the only thing left for me is an action item to document it.&lt;br/&gt;[19:01] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm not sure why I didn't edit the agenda last time.&lt;br/&gt;[19:02] &lt;seb128&gt; so, looks like I'm chair for this one :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:02] &lt;seb128&gt; #startmeeting Technical Board&lt;br/&gt;[19:02] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting started at 19:02:30 UTC.

The whole user namespaces thing?&lt;br/&gt;[19:10] &lt;georgiag&gt; ahasenack: correct. instead of outright denying the creation of unpriv user namespaces, we created the unprivileged_userns profile which we transition to (from unconfined) when trying to create the userns. the only thing is that this profile does not allow the use of capabilities&lt;br/&gt;[19:11] &lt;ahasenack&gt; and if it were to deny that (i.e., if capabilities were tried), I would see a DENIED message?&lt;br/&gt;[19:12] &lt;georgiag&gt; ahasenack: yes. unprivileged_userns has the rule "audit deny capability,"&lt;br/&gt;[19:12] &lt;ahasenack&gt; ok, I have no denies, so the problem must be elsewhere&lt;br/&gt;[20:29] &lt;ahasenack&gt; georgiag: ok, turns out this test needs capabilities&lt;br/&gt;[20:29] &lt;ahasenack&gt; but I didn't see a DENIED in the logs, just the AUDIT&lt;br/&gt;[20:29] &lt;ahasenack&gt; does the AUDIT log differentiate between deny and allow?&lt;br/&gt;[20:29] &lt;ahasenack&gt; or maybe I just missed it&lt;br/&gt;[20:29] &lt;ahasenack&gt; profile unprivileged_userns {&lt;br/&gt;[20:29] &lt;ahasenack&gt;      audit deny capability,&lt;br/&gt;[20:30] &lt;ahasenack&gt; changing that to allow made the command pass&lt;br/&gt;[20:37] &lt;ahasenack&gt; with "deny", this is all I get in dmesg (and the command fails):&lt;br/&gt;[20:37] &lt;ahasenack&gt; [Mon Sep  9 20:36:51 2024] audit: type=1400 audit(1725914211.708:171): apparmor="AUDIT" operation="userns_create" class="namespace" info="Userns create - transitioning profile" profile="unconfined" pid=50889 comm="unshare" requested="userns_create" target="unprivileged_userns"&lt;br/&gt;[20:37] &lt;ahasenack&gt; if I change that to allow, the command works&lt;br/&gt;[20:37] &lt;ahasenack&gt; and I get one extra apparmor AUDIT log&lt;br/&gt;[20:37] &lt;ahasenack&gt; apparmor="AUDIT" operation="capable" class="cap" profile="unprivileged_userns" pid=50944 comm="mkfs.ext4" capability=2  capname="dac_read_search"&lt;br/&gt;[20:37] &lt;georgiag&gt; ahasenack: AUDIT appears only when the rule contains audit or if the profile contains the audit and/or complain flags&lt;br/&gt;[20:37] &lt;ahasenack&gt; so capabilities being denied was nog logged&lt;br/&gt;[20:39] &lt;georgiag&gt; I wonder if the log is being discarded or if there's a bug somewhere&lt;br/&gt;[20:39] &lt;ahasenack&gt; let me try to get you a simple reproducer&lt;br/&gt;[20:40] &lt;ahasenack&gt; hm&lt;br/&gt;[20:40] &lt;ahasenack&gt; no, let me write this up before&lt;br/&gt;[20:41] &lt;georgiag&gt; thanks&lt;br/&gt;[20:50] &lt;ahasenack&gt; georgiag: ok, try this please: https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/k4TvXHWsz7/&lt;br/&gt;[20:51] &lt;ahasenack&gt; I can't tell you yet what is wrong/right, just that I'm missing a DENIED in the logs&lt;br/&gt;[20:51] &lt;ahasenack&gt; and it looks like this unshare command needs capabilities indeed, and I need to find a way to grant it in this test case&lt;br/&gt;[21:01] &lt;ahasenack&gt; is this the kind of exploit we want to avoid with the userns apparmor rule? https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/D8pKmFvv5t/ Note there I changed the capability to allow (from deny)&lt;br/&gt;[21:02]  * ahasenack wonders how many people in this channel highlight on "exploit" ;)&lt;br/&gt;[21:03] &lt;ahasenack&gt; with execsnoop: https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/rGcCTvs5zc/&lt;br/&gt;[21:05] &lt;rlee287&gt; ahasenack: quick sanity check: are you getting the missing entries even with printk ratelimiting disabled?&lt;br/&gt;[21:06] &lt;ahasenack&gt; rlee287: I didn't touch rate limiting, but since I can flip back and forth and repeat it as will, without missing messages between the attempts&lt;br/&gt;[21:06] &lt;ahasenack&gt; s/as will/at will/&lt;br/&gt;[21:06] &lt;ahasenack&gt; this is an oracular vm, btw&lt;br/&gt;[21:07] &lt;rlee287&gt; OK, might want to turn off printk ratelimiting just in case, still&lt;br/&gt;[21:08] &lt;rlee287&gt; Taking a look at the first pastebin&lt;br/&gt;[21:13] &lt;georgiag&gt; ahasenack: I'm not sure if that's exactly what we are trying to prevent, but it's mostly related to privilege escalation using kernel bugs. so in a user namespace one would be root and have CAP_NET_ADMIN, then they could leverage a bug in the network stack to gain privilege out of the user namespace&lt;br/&gt;[21:14] &lt;rlee287&gt; I didn't get the permission denied error that you did, although I had to install the uidmap package first&lt;br/&gt;[21:14] &lt;rlee287&gt; I did install a kernel from a PPA though so let me check first whether the issue occurs without the PPA&lt;br/&gt;[21:14] &lt;ahasenack&gt; this is simplifying a dep8 test that started to fail in noble&lt;br/&gt;[21:15] &lt;ahasenack&gt; I don't think the test has corrupted the environment, but I could have missed something&lt;br/&gt;[21:16] &lt;ahasenack&gt; this is the test, and the command that is failing is on this line: https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nbd/tree/debian/tests/initrd-boot?h=applied/ubuntu/devel#n36&lt;br/&gt;[21:17] &lt;ahasenack&gt; it fails in multiple places, I addressed some, and the last one is that unshare command from the pastebins that is doing mkfs.ext4&lt;br/&gt;[21:18] &lt;rlee287&gt; OK; reproduced your permission denied error with the stock Ubuntu kernel&lt;br/&gt;[21:18] &lt;rlee287&gt; *Ubuntu oracular kernel&lt;br/&gt;[21:19] &lt;rlee287&gt; We (AppArmor team) have a 6.11 in-development kernel installable from https://launchpad.net/~apparmor-dev/+archive/ubuntu/prompt-dev/+packages with a number of fixes&lt;br/&gt;[21:20] &lt;rlee287&gt; And the issue you ran into doesn't manifest when I have that kernel installed&lt;br/&gt;[21:20] &lt;ahasenack&gt; just to refresh, which permission denied error did you try to reproduce?&lt;br/&gt;[21:20] &lt;rlee287&gt; The first pastebin that you sent, with the hello.txt and permission denied with only an AUDIT entry (but no DENIED entry)&lt;br/&gt;[21:21] &lt;rlee287&gt; jjohansen: did you apply a bugfix to your kernel recently that would have fixed this?&lt;br/&gt;[21:22] &lt;jjohansen&gt; uhmmm, give me a minute to read back scroll&lt;br/&gt;[21:23] &lt;ahasenack&gt; rlee287: this one? https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/k4TvXHWsz7/&lt;br/&gt;[21:23] &lt;rlee287&gt; Yep&lt;br/&gt;[21:23] &lt;ahasenack&gt; jjohansen: ^&lt;br/&gt;[21:24] &lt;rlee287&gt; *where the permission denied without a DENIED log occurs with a stock Oracular kernel but not the prompt-dev PPA kernel&lt;br/&gt;[21:24] &lt;ahasenack&gt; rlee287: so in the prompt-dev kernel, you still had a denied in the terminal, AND a DENIED in the logs? Or what was different?&lt;br/&gt;[21:25] &lt;rlee287&gt; In the prompt-dev kernel the cat worked and there was only the AUDIT corresponding to the transition, as expected&lt;br/&gt;[21:25] &lt;ahasenack&gt; the cat worked, with the "audit deny capability," line in the profile?&lt;br/&gt;[21:25] &lt;rlee287&gt; Yep&lt;br/&gt;[21:26] &lt;rlee287&gt; Might have misremembered if there was an AUDIT print with the new kernel actually, let me recheck&lt;br/&gt;[21:27] &lt;jjohansen&gt; ahasenack: by stock you mean the 6.8 kernel correct? not the 6.11 kernel in -proposed&lt;br/&gt;[21:27] &lt;ahasenack&gt; 6.8.0-31&lt;br/&gt;[21:32] &lt;jjohansen&gt; so I don't remember and can't see anything that would fix/change the auditing of the capability between 6.8 and 6.11&lt;br/&gt;[21:32] &lt;rlee287&gt; Actually, it isn't working with the new kernel either this time, huh&lt;br/&gt;[21:32] &lt;rlee287&gt; It did work for me when I tried it after setting up the prompt testing stuff; let me investigate further&lt;br/&gt;[21:32] &lt;jjohansen&gt; my guess is its the capability audit cache, that is tripping, preventing it from being audited&lt;br/&gt;[21:35] &lt;ahasenack&gt; my other question is, when I change that capability rule to allow, I can do this: https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/rGcCTvs5zc/&lt;br/&gt;[21:36] &lt;jjohansen&gt; capabilities fire at such a high rate, there is a small special dedup cache, that stores the last profile and last set of caps audited&lt;br/&gt;[21:37] &lt;jjohansen&gt; so if there was a denial previously, before caps were audited for a different profile it would effectively hide the caps request&lt;br/&gt;[21:37] &lt;jjohansen&gt; the cache needs to be made smarter so it ages out after a few seconds, but atm it doesn't&lt;br/&gt;[21:43] &lt;rlee287&gt; exit&lt;br/&gt;[21:43] &lt;rlee287&gt; *whoops, that was meant for my terminal&lt;br/&gt;[21:45] &lt;jjohansen&gt; nice passwd ;)&lt;br/&gt;[22:02] &lt;rlee287&gt; Now I'm unable to reproduce the cat command working the first time, and when I audit allow capabilities I also get a DAC_READ_SEARCH audit&lt;br/&gt;[22:02] &lt;rlee287&gt; No idea what might have happened the first time; sorry if I got your hopes up&lt;br/&gt;[22:03] &lt;jjohansen&gt; rlee287: create a dummy profile, using a different name, stick the rules&lt;br/&gt;[22:03] &lt;jjohansen&gt;   allow all,&lt;br/&gt;[22:03] &lt;jjohansen&gt;   deny capability,&lt;br/&gt;[22:03] &lt;jjohansen&gt; in it&lt;br/&gt;[22:04] &lt;jjohansen&gt; use aa-exec -p dummy_profile_name -- your exe&lt;br/&gt;[22:04] &lt;jjohansen&gt; the goal here is to get a different profile name in the dedup cache&lt;br/&gt;[22:05] &lt;jjohansen&gt; oop, make that "audit deny capability"&lt;br/&gt;[22:05] &lt;jjohansen&gt; after you get a deny for that, you should be able to get 1 capabilty deny message again for the other&lt;br/&gt;[22:06] &lt;jjohansen&gt; I am pretty sure you are seeing the capability cache dedup behavior&lt;br/&gt;[22:06] &lt;jjohansen&gt; I have an nice little kernel project for you :)&lt;br/&gt;[22:12] &lt;rlee287&gt; With the dummy profile I get the DENIED print, but I get no DENIED prints for the raw unshare (without the aa-exec)&lt;br/&gt;[22:14] &lt;rlee287&gt;

The Ubuntu Membership is this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership - something that is in a way much broader, and really not specific to any development contribution.&lt;br/&gt;[12:19] &lt;mapreri&gt; https://launchpad.net/~ubuntumembers&lt;br/&gt;[12:19] &lt;Kilos&gt; Do you have and supporters here?&lt;br/&gt;[12:20] &lt;nteodosio&gt; There is only one endorsement in the Wiki page, seb128, who is not in this particular channel right now.&lt;br/&gt;[12:21] &lt;mapreri&gt; nteodosio: personally (which might be different than others in the membership board), I consider the fact that one person should clearly feel "part of ubuntu" and have a view of "what can I do to make ubuntu, and its community, better and better", and I like to perceive this as part of the application :)&lt;br/&gt;[12:21] &lt;mapreri&gt; nteodosio: right, but that's for the contributing developer thing, not for the "ubuntu membership" part.&lt;br/&gt;[12:22] &lt;mapreri&gt; although several teams (MOTU at least, not sure about the ~ubuntu-developer-members) also inherit all the parts of ~ubuntumembers too&lt;br/&gt;[12:23] &lt;nteodosio&gt; Thanks for the feedback, I'll keep that in mind for the next meeting â if today we're not getting quorum that is.&lt;br/&gt;[12:23] &lt;mapreri&gt; alright, yes ~ubuntu-developer-members is a subteam of ~ubuntumembers&lt;br/&gt;[12:24] &lt;nteodosio&gt; The requirements are these though: https://ubuntu.com/community/membership/requirements&lt;br/&gt;[12:26] &lt;mapreri&gt; yep&lt;br/&gt;[12:27] &lt;nteodosio&gt; If ubuntu-developer-member (udm) is a sub-team of ubuntumembers (um), then is it right to assume I don't have to ask someone who endorsed the udm to rewrite his endorsement to um?&lt;br/&gt;[12:28] &lt;mapreri&gt; rather, you should apply directly to them (to the DMB) rather than with us&lt;br/&gt;[12:29] &lt;mapreri&gt; I suppose here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopers#Ubuntu_Contributing_Developers&lt;br/&gt;[12:29] &lt;mapreri&gt; https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperMembershipBoard/ApplicationProcess&lt;br/&gt;[12:29] &lt;nteodosio&gt; By which you mean I should apply to Contributor Developer rather than Ubuntu Member?&lt;br/&gt;[12:30] &lt;fenris&gt; ello .. apologies for the late joining the meeting&lt;br/&gt;[12:30] &lt;mapreri&gt; nteodosio: I mean, you did write https://wiki.ubuntu.com/nteodosio/contributing-developer-application which is for contributing developer?&lt;br/&gt;[12:31] &lt;mapreri&gt; I'mâ¦ also confused :3&lt;br/&gt;[12:31] &lt;nteodosio&gt; Yeah let's recapitulate :). if I go to https://ubuntu.com/community/membership/requirements and I believe I match the requirements, I to follow the "ready to apply" at the bottom of it, which tells me to create the discourse post, which is https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/nathan-teodosio-membership-application/46796, and then be at one meeting in #ubuntu-meeting.&lt;br/&gt;[12:32] &lt;mapreri&gt; right&lt;br/&gt;[12:32] &lt;nteodosio&gt; So here I am. :D&lt;br/&gt;[12:32] &lt;mapreri&gt; cool&lt;br/&gt;[12:34] &lt;mapreri&gt; incidentally, we did reach a quorum with fenris joining, so we could go ahead with this nowâ¦&lt;br/&gt;[12:34] &lt;Kilos&gt; I would accept him. the probs come in with canonical guys, they dont understand the whole ubuntu thing&lt;br/&gt;[12:35] &lt;mapreri&gt; btw, to recapitulate a bit more: there are two membership: this one and the developer one.  the developer one implies this "wider" one.  the developer one is taken care of by a different team at different meeting.&lt;br/&gt;[12:41] &lt;mapreri&gt; the person I believe would chair for us says they are too sleepy to do so :3&lt;br/&gt;[12:41] &lt;mapreri&gt; nteodosio: so let's get this meeting formally in place if you agree!&lt;br/&gt;[12:41] &lt;mapreri&gt; (unless you don't want to anymore)&lt;br/&gt;[12:41] &lt;nteodosio&gt; mapreri, sure let's go!&lt;br/&gt;[12:42] &lt;mapreri&gt; #startmeeting Ubuntu Membership Board&lt;br/&gt;[12:42] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting started at 12:42:43 UTC.

The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards&lt;br/&gt;[12:43] &lt;mapreri&gt; We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.&lt;br/&gt;[12:43] &lt;mapreri&gt; The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).&lt;br/&gt;[12:43] &lt;mapreri&gt; Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.&lt;br/&gt;[12:43] &lt;mapreri&gt; During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.&lt;br/&gt;[12:43] &lt;mapreri&gt; When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)&lt;br/&gt;[12:43] &lt;mapreri&gt; Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...&lt;br/&gt;[12:43] &lt;mapreri&gt; #topic Nathan Teodosio  @nteodosio&lt;br/&gt;[12:44] &lt;mapreri&gt; #link https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/nathan-teodosio-membership-application/46796&lt;br/&gt;[12:44] &lt;mapreri&gt; nteodosio: feel free to give a short introduction of yourself&lt;br/&gt;[12:45] &lt;nteodosio&gt; I'm at the desktop team for little more than two years, mainly maintaining Chromium but also participating on maintaince of the desktop snaps and deb desktop packages.&lt;br/&gt;[12:47] &lt;fenris&gt; a part of contributing to the project codes, merging request , assigned bugs .. can we know what other contributions you has involve or participate?&lt;br/&gt;[12:48] &lt;nteodosio&gt; Hmm you mean apart from contributing to maintenance work?&lt;br/&gt;[12:48] &lt;fenris&gt; yeah&lt;br/&gt;[12:49] &lt;nteodosio&gt; Nothing comes to mind, can you give me one example of what would fit your question? Documentation?&lt;br/&gt;[12:50] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; nteodosio: Put another way: As an Canonical employee - what does acquiring Ubuntu Membership mean to you ?&lt;br/&gt;[12:52] &lt;nteodosio&gt; Bashing-om, to me it means I'm a trusted member of the chain. That means that, e.g., if I were to leave Canonical I would still be a part of Ubuntu&lt;br/&gt;[12:52] &lt;nteodosio&gt; Which also implies that my contributions to Ubuntu are not tied to that.&lt;br/&gt;[12:53] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; nteodosio: Good point - thanks.&lt;br/&gt;[12:53] &lt;nteodosio&gt; You are welcome.&lt;br/&gt;[12:54] &lt;mapreri&gt; what are you thoughts about more ubuntu promotion amongst the masses?  You are part of the desktop team, so I suppose you want more "normal" users to use ubuntu (i.e., not necessarily developers or servers, etc).&lt;br/&gt;[12:55] &lt;nteodosio&gt; Yes indeed, that's why I think it is important to keep supporting the GUI stuff even if they are "easy" CLI counterparts. I know that the latter is a bit scary, I remember when I was in that position too.&lt;br/&gt;[12:56] &lt;nteodosio&gt; So for example I really like contributing to software-properties and update-manager even if they can be replaced by say editing /etc/apt/sources.list{,d/} or apt update; apt upgrade.&lt;br/&gt;[12:57] &lt;nteodosio&gt; I'm not the one doing the promotion in the sense of "spreading it" outside of my personal circle but I belive that by keeping software good and intuitive that comes naturally.&lt;br/&gt;[12:57] &lt;mapreri&gt; any interest in helping out your local community (if there is one)?&lt;br/&gt;[12:57] &lt;nteodosio&gt; You mean geografically local?&lt;br/&gt;[12:58] &lt;fenris&gt; i was about to ask the same&lt;br/&gt;[12:58] &lt;Kilos&gt; ubuntu has loco teams all over,&lt;br/&gt;[12:58] &lt;fenris&gt; are you joining any Ubuntu project group especially your LoCo?&lt;br/&gt;[12:58] &lt;mapreri&gt; https://ubuntu.com/community/locos&lt;br/&gt;[12:59] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; nteodosio: In some event that you and Canonical have a parting of ways - what means are at your disposal to continue Ubuntu contributions ?&lt;br/&gt;[12:59] &lt;nteodosio&gt; I am not member of any such group until now, giving a quick look at it I would be happy to join. So far I normally hang around in #ubuntu and try to help when I can.&lt;br/&gt;[13:00] &lt;nteodosio&gt; Bashing-om, as I don't have upload rights to any package, parting with Canonical would not alter my way of contributing, namely debdiff sponsoring or merge requests.&lt;br/&gt;[13:00] &lt;mapreri&gt; alright&lt;br/&gt;[13:00] &lt;nteodosio&gt; Only with regards to Chromium we'd need to adjust access I think.&lt;br/&gt;[13:01] &lt;mapreri&gt; Let's call for votes!&lt;br/&gt;[13:01] &lt;nteodosio&gt; As right now I have direct write access to it (I didn't have for the Bionic deb of course).&lt;br/&gt;[13:01] &lt;nteodosio&gt; Ack.&lt;br/&gt;[13:01] &lt;mapreri&gt; #vote Ubuntu Membership for nteodosio&lt;br/&gt;[13:01] &lt;meetingology&gt; Please vote on: Ubuntu Membership for nteodosio&lt;br/&gt;[13:01] &lt;meetingology&gt; Public votes can be registered by saying +1, -1 or +0 in channel (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1|-1|+0 #channelname')&lt;br/&gt;[13:01] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[13:01] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 received from Bashing-om&lt;br/&gt;[13:02] &lt;Kilos&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[13:02] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 received from Kilos&lt;br/&gt;[13:03] &lt;mapreri&gt; mh&lt;br/&gt;[13:05] &lt;mapreri&gt; 0 - you have clearly contributed for quite a while, and my perception is that you might indeed want to approach "the community side" a bit more.  0 mostly because it feels you are a bit lost on what the community actually is, but not -1 as you do have plenty of (code) contributions -taking the time to also send them to debian, etc.&lt;br/&gt;[13:05] &lt;meetingology&gt; 0 - you have clearly contributed for quite a while, and my perception is that you might indeed want to approach "the community side" a bit more.  0 mostly because it feels you are a bit lost on what the community actually is, but not -1 as you do have plenty of (code) contributions -taking the time to also send them to debian, etc. received from mapreri&lt;br/&gt;[13:05] &lt;fenris&gt; 0&lt;br/&gt;[13:05] &lt;meetingology&gt; 0 received from fenris&lt;br/&gt;[13:05] &lt;mapreri&gt; #endvote&lt;br/&gt;[13:05] &lt;meetingology&gt; Voting ended on: Ubuntu Membership for nteodosio&lt;br/&gt;[13:05] &lt;meetingology&gt; Votes for: 2, Votes against: 0, Abstentions: 2&lt;br/&gt;[13:05] &lt;meetingology&gt; Motion carried&lt;br/&gt;[13:05] &lt;mapreri&gt; well, this is it!&lt;br/&gt;[13:06] &lt;mapreri&gt; Congratulations to all the new members.

If it is unlikely to land, then we could work to undo the transition for 24.10 and redo it next cycle.&lt;br/&gt;[14:48] &lt;joalif&gt; slyon: I was at another meeting, I'll take care of the MIR&lt;br/&gt;[14:49] &lt;slyon&gt; thx joalif!&lt;br/&gt;[14:50] &lt;jbicha&gt; (you could also look into it and get back to me about it)&lt;br/&gt;[14:50] &lt;slyon&gt; I see a bunch of security review piling up, especially for the desktop team.&lt;br/&gt;[14:50] &lt;sarnold&gt; heh yeah i'll have ot do that :( the included copies of crypto code is slightly worrying&lt;br/&gt;[14:50] &lt;sarnold&gt; so much :(&lt;br/&gt;[14:51] &lt;slyon&gt; maybe c_paelzer can help raising severity for getting new security reviewers once he's back from PTO..&lt;br/&gt;[14:51] &lt;slyon&gt; But they'd also need to be trained first :(&lt;br/&gt;[14:51] &lt;sarnold&gt; we did make some progress on sysprof, but otherwise it's a real challenge to get time from folks due to deadlines from $elsewhere&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;slyon&gt; ACK.

Because non-venored dependencies have been unfeasible for now (although it would be nicer/prefered)&lt;br/&gt;[14:56] &lt;jamespage&gt; ok I was looking for prior art to follow - python-cryptography is similar&lt;br/&gt;[14:57] &lt;sarnold&gt; is that newly rustic?&lt;br/&gt;[14:57] &lt;jamespage&gt; rpds-py? its in the dependency chain for jsonschema updates coming from debian&lt;br/&gt;[14:57] &lt;sarnold&gt; I wonder if that started doing rust after it was in main, and perhaps never got real attention to it after a transition&lt;br/&gt;[14:57] &lt;jamespage&gt; replacement for pyrsistent which is in main (but scheduled for demoition)&lt;br/&gt;[14:58] &lt;slyon&gt; If the dependency tree is small enough, it would still be nicer to do static linking from rust packages BD's, but we might not have all the correct verions in the archive and it might need lots of additional MIR paperwork for each of the BDs. So vendoring it all into the python package is the more streamlined approach&lt;br/&gt;[14:58] &lt;sarnold&gt; sorry, I meant the python-cryptography -- I'm curious if it actually serves as a good example of what we decided on&lt;br/&gt;[14:58] &lt;jamespage&gt; it did switch once in main yes&lt;br/&gt;[14:58] &lt;jamespage&gt; its small&lt;br/&gt;[14:58] &lt;jamespage&gt; https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/nivxTBBl/&lt;br/&gt;[14:59] &lt;jamespage&gt; that does pull in a load of other librust-*-dev packages&lt;br/&gt;[14:59] &lt;slyon&gt; ^ that's the problem&lt;br/&gt;[15:00] &lt;jamespage&gt; infact more than a few - loads&lt;br/&gt;[15:00] &lt;jamespage&gt; ok so I need to vendor in what's needed&lt;br/&gt;[15:00] &lt;slyon&gt; we'd need to work through the whole tree of librust-*-dev packages, doing MIRs. Which was deemed infeasible in the past.&lt;br/&gt;[15:00] &lt;slyon&gt; ACK. Vendoring is the way forward here.&lt;br/&gt;[15:01] &lt;sarnold&gt; did we have a nice discussion somewhere of the best way to approach that problem?&lt;br/&gt;[15:01] &lt;slyon&gt; jamespage: there's been some discussion about how to best trim the set of vendored dependnecies to a minimum, I think this is the starting point: https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues/51&lt;br/&gt;[15:01] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Issue 51 in canonical/ubuntu-mir "cargo vendor adds unnecessary crates" [Closed]&lt;br/&gt;[15:02] &lt;jamespage&gt; thanks for all of the pointers :)&lt;br/&gt;[15:02] &lt;slyon&gt; Do we have anything else for AOB?&lt;br/&gt;[15:02] &lt;sarnold&gt; nothing here&lt;br/&gt;[15:03] &lt;slyon&gt; 3.2.1&lt;br/&gt;[15:03] &lt;slyon&gt; thanks all! o/&lt;br/&gt;[15:03] &lt;sarnold&gt; thanks slyon, all :)&lt;br/&gt;[15:03] &lt;slyon&gt; #endmeeting&lt;br/&gt;[15:03] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting ended at 15:03:26 UTC.

#topic seeded snaps policy, snap channels, and things moving fast?&lt;br/&gt;[19:14] &lt;vorlon&gt; so, related to the draft policy :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:16] &lt;vorlon&gt; it appears that Oliver, on behalf of the Ubuntu Desktop team, has been pushing hard to get some changes made to how snaps are seeded on the Ubuntu image; using snap tracks that would align to major upstream versions of the software included in a given Ubuntu release, as opposed to the policy we've had up to now which is effectively latest/stable/ubuntu-XX.YY&lt;br/&gt;[19:16] &lt;rbasak&gt; That's part of the draft policy&lt;br/&gt;[19:16] &lt;vorlon&gt; I can see the motivation for such a change, and it's mentioned in the draft policy&lt;br/&gt;[19:17] &lt;rbasak&gt; Sorry I'll let you finish&lt;br/&gt;[19:17] &lt;vorlon&gt; however, when I looked at draft policy, this seemed to be covered only in an appendix which was not part of what I recalled having been asked to review as part of the normative language to be adopted by the TB&lt;br/&gt;[19:18] &lt;vorlon&gt; and things are going full speed ahead, with Oliver working with sil2100 to actually make changes to the snap channels used in the install media for 24.04.1&lt;br/&gt;[19:18] &lt;vorlon&gt; (which was originally scheduled for this week and is now pushed out 2 weeks)&lt;br/&gt;[19:18] &lt;vorlon&gt; so I wanted to flag this and see if it was my misunderstanding, that I hadn't spent appropriate time on the appendix, or if others had a similar disconnect?&lt;br/&gt;[19:19] &lt;rbasak&gt; I think there's possibly a misunderstanding here.&lt;br/&gt;[19:19] &lt;rbasak&gt; Let me try describing my perspective.&lt;br/&gt;[19:19] &lt;rbasak&gt; Principle 1 of the draft policy (in the main text, not an appendix) requires stability of behaviour.&lt;br/&gt;[19:20] &lt;rbasak&gt; As written, that rules out things like firefox following a "latest" snap track&lt;br/&gt;[19:21] &lt;rbasak&gt; So therefore, setting aside exceptions for the moment, the implementation of Principle 1 in snaps *requires* the following of a snap track that isn't "latest", but instead some track that is mapped from an Ubuntu release.&lt;br/&gt;[19:21] &lt;rbasak&gt; "latest" then is only used when the TB grants an exception, or a historical one is implied, such as for Firefox&lt;br/&gt;[19:22] &lt;rbasak&gt; Therefore, I don't see a need for changing the main body of the text. The appendix describes how snaps implement the principles as well as how an exception to principle 1 is handled.&lt;br/&gt;[19:22] &lt;vorlon&gt; understood&lt;br/&gt;[19:22] &lt;rbasak&gt; &lt;/perspective&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[19:22] &lt;rbasak&gt; How does that fit with your concern?&lt;br/&gt;[19:24] &lt;rbasak&gt; FWIW, when I spoke to Oliver about this, his concern was the current _inability_ to use not-latest snap tracks in the current implementation.&lt;br/&gt;[19:24] &lt;vorlon&gt; I personally think that latest/stable/&lt;branch&gt; does not give a guarantee either direction and that it would not be against the intent of this policy to use it, especially given that the &lt;branch&gt; exists to be an escape hatch&lt;br/&gt;[19:24] &lt;rbasak&gt; But what he wanted to achieve seemed exactly aligned with our draft.&lt;br/&gt;[19:24] &lt;vorlon&gt; and I want to unblock this as an option for them&lt;br/&gt;[19:24] &lt;vorlon&gt; I'm not sure if I think it should go in the normative text&lt;br/&gt;[19:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; but there's 3 of us here which means provided amurray agrees that this plan is fine, I think we can move forward?&lt;br/&gt;[19:25] &lt;rbasak&gt; I think it's OK, if the latest track is expected to be stable in behaviour and meeting Principle 1, to consider use of the latest track to be compliant with the draft policy.&lt;br/&gt;[19:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; I just didn't want it to happen by accident in case my misunderstanding of the draft was shared&lt;br/&gt;[19:26] &lt;rbasak&gt; didn't want it to happen by accident&gt; define "it", please?&lt;br/&gt;[19:27] &lt;amurray&gt; so my understanding is that the desktop team is not using latest here but versioned tracks like '1' or '2' etc - but I also think the current policy doesn't preclude the use of latest - and nor should it - but I think this should very much be an exception, as I suspect it could be easy to accidentally abuse it&lt;br/&gt;[19:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; rbasak: that we were changing the de facto policy for seeded snaps on the images, based on a bit of the draft that you had written and of course endorse but that I wasn't sure the rest of the TB had actually read&lt;br/&gt;[19:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; (read and considered)&lt;br/&gt;[19:27] &lt;rbasak&gt; Ah, OK&lt;br/&gt;[19:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; amurray: today it's actually using latest, they want to move to versioned tracks effective 24.04.1&lt;br/&gt;[19:28] &lt;rbasak&gt; I was under the impression that the TB were OK with the direction, so didn't see the need to ask for anything to be held pending ratification&lt;br/&gt;[19:29] &lt;amurray&gt; vorlon - yes, sorry I should have clarified - I meant the desktop team is planning to use versioned tracks - and by abuse it I mean that if a publisher uses latest they would potentially be more likely to ship new features / introduce regressions etc&lt;br/&gt;[19:29]  * vorlon nods&lt;br/&gt;[19:29] &lt;amurray&gt; but in this case the use of a branch along with latest should make this less of a risk&lt;br/&gt;[19:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok then I think that's enough to move forward with, thanks&lt;br/&gt;[19:30] &lt;rbasak&gt; Are there any changes you'd like to make to the draft on this point?&lt;br/&gt;[19:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; it's likely that sil2100, having been the one moving forward with implementation, also agrees with this but I hadn't had a chance to talk to him about it yet :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; rbasak: not at this time but I'm going to try to give it a look later today, thanks&lt;br/&gt;[19:30] &lt;rbasak&gt; ack.

So keys are never deleted as such. On the Launchpad end, users list their keys, so to get Launchpad to stop treating a key as valid, the user can remove it.

Like I tried to tell&lt;br/&gt;[22:17] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; A better karma between companies and individuals&lt;br/&gt;[22:17] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; Also has a phone still supported by UBports&lt;br/&gt;[22:17] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; volla phone etc&lt;br/&gt;[22:17] &lt;sarnold&gt; ubports is completely separate from canonical these days&lt;br/&gt;[22:17] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; I'm interested in Purism also which is GTK and Debian based&lt;br/&gt;[22:18] &lt;sarnold&gt; a group of enthusiasts have kept it alive&lt;br/&gt;[22:18] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; yes I know&lt;br/&gt;[22:18] &lt;sarnold&gt; okay good good&lt;br/&gt;[22:18] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; But That thing ubuntu-touch still lives despite canonical left the project&lt;br/&gt;[22:18] &lt;sarnold&gt; ubuntu is popular with both enterprises and enthusiasts, largely because a lot of things "just work"&lt;br/&gt;[22:18] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; yes&lt;br/&gt;[22:18] &lt;sarnold&gt; some very demanding workloads like SAP or Oracle DB might be hyper-tuned for RHEL or SLES&lt;br/&gt;[22:19] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; understood&lt;br/&gt;[22:19] &lt;sarnold&gt; and some very demanding enthusiasts might be a better fit for arch :)&lt;br/&gt;[22:19] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; I don't know about arch&lt;br/&gt;[22:19] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; I didn't try it&lt;br/&gt;[22:19] &lt;sarnold&gt; our packages come through debian unstable before they enter our devel release, and every six months we ship it. arch may do a better job of providing very fresh versions of a wider variety of packages.&lt;br/&gt;[22:20] &lt;sarnold&gt; I've never tried it either :( I think we'd like it, if only we'd try it, hehe&lt;br/&gt;[22:20] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; yes maybe blackarch :D&lt;br/&gt;[22:20] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; tons of tools&lt;br/&gt;[22:21] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; do you contribute to any spesific security tool like wireshark or any other /&lt;br/&gt;[22:21] &lt;sarnold&gt; apparmor, though it's been a while since I contributed in any significant way&lt;br/&gt;[22:24] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; hmm let me check the source code&lt;br/&gt;[22:26] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; do you please give the repository link sarnold ?&lt;br/&gt;[22:26] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; is it on GitLab ? &lt;br/&gt;[22:26] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor&lt;br/&gt;[22:28] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; https://apparmor.net/&lt;br/&gt;[22:28] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; also&lt;br/&gt;[22:29] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; okay cool Thanks&lt;br/&gt;[22:34] &lt;sarnold&gt; hwpplayer1: heh yeah that's the one ;)&lt;br/&gt;[22:40] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; great&lt;br/&gt;[22:40] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; Do you have Zram on your Ubuntu machines ?&lt;br/&gt;[22:41] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; I have 8(7.6 when calculated) GB RAM and 70 GB Zram &lt;br/&gt;[22:41] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; 76 or 70 idk&lt;br/&gt;[22:41] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; :D&lt;br/&gt;[22:44] &lt;sarnold&gt; zounds :)&lt;br/&gt;[22:44] &lt;sarnold&gt; I don't think I've got zram or zswap configured&lt;br/&gt;[22:44] &lt;sarnold&gt; I keep meaning to give it a try but it's never a top priority for me&lt;br/&gt;[22:45] &lt;oerheks&gt; what if system borks ans zram cannot write a log?&lt;br/&gt;[22:45] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; I configured it for mobile development like Android Qt mobile and Ubuntu Touch&lt;br/&gt;[22:45] &lt;oerheks&gt; ans/and&lt;br/&gt;[22:45] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; I am totally new to this tech&lt;br/&gt;[22:48] &lt;Juest&gt; except when ubuntu constantly has issues, particularly livecds whereas debian is fine&lt;br/&gt;[22:48] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; I run Debian 12&lt;br/&gt;[22:49] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; I think that it crashes when GNOME extensions are enabled&lt;br/&gt;[22:49] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; Same for Ubuntu 22.04 &lt;br/&gt;[22:49] &lt;Juest&gt; yeah umm, this is a channel to discuss ubuntu security matters, do you have a on topic question?&lt;br/&gt;[22:50] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; system crashes are on topic ?&lt;br/&gt;[22:50] &lt;Juest&gt; sounds like #linux or #ubuntu is a better fit for you. system crashes are more a support thing not security. &lt;br/&gt;[22:51] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; thanks&lt;br/&gt;[22:51] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; I'll stay here to be connected&lt;br/&gt;[22:51] &lt;oerheks&gt; 'constantly has issues' .. lets talk about that&lt;br/&gt;[22:51] &lt;Juest&gt; well, you stay connected to the network server if you leave a channel&lt;br/&gt;[22:52] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; I mean I'll read this channel's messages&lt;br/&gt;[22:52] &lt;Juest&gt; oerheks: im more talking past experiences really, its not as bad nowadays and frankly i do not interact too often with the live environment&lt;br/&gt;[22:52] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; It is a buffer in Emacs&lt;br/&gt;[22:52] &lt;Juest&gt; cool&lt;br/&gt;[22:53] &lt;oerheks&gt; if one needs a live environment, use a daily build&lt;br/&gt;[22:53] &lt;Juest&gt; oh so for installation/rescue/live is it preferred to use the bleeding edge isos?&lt;br/&gt;[22:54] &lt;Juest&gt; or what did you mean by daily build?&lt;br/&gt;[22:55] &lt;oerheks&gt; https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/ for desktop, sure you can find server and such&lt;br/&gt;[22:56] &lt;Juest&gt; thanks, oddly enough this is not recommended/noted anywhere&lt;br/&gt;[22:58] &lt;oerheks&gt; one must have a reason to do so, i guess&lt;br/&gt;[22:58] &lt;Juest&gt; i see, i mean its not really advertised or anything, but good to know there's that choice for those who dont mind recycling isos&lt;br/&gt;[22:58] &lt;Juest&gt; hmm, cdimage.ubuntu seems to only contain desktop stuff?&lt;br/&gt;[22:59] &lt;Juest&gt; oh is probably in ubuntu-server&lt;br/&gt;[22:59] &lt;Juest&gt; i see that the spins folders are there on the root&lt;br/&gt;[22:59] &lt;oerheks&gt; yes even cloud images https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/buildd/daily/&lt;br/&gt;[22:59] &lt;sarnold&gt; heh yeah we've got downloads scattered over so many domains :/&lt;br/&gt;[23:00] &lt;oerheks&gt; but that is more likely&lt;br/&gt;[23:00] &lt;sarnold&gt; s/domains/subdomains/&lt;br/&gt;[23:01] &lt;Juest&gt; oerheks: interesting, the buildd folder is not exposed in the homepage of cloud-images and it says in the description that its technically not supported for bug reports&lt;br/&gt;[23:02] &lt;Juest&gt; and oci is empty&lt;br/&gt;[23:02] &lt;oerheks&gt; i think technically it is, as it contains the latest updates&lt;br/&gt;[23:02] &lt;Juest&gt; anyways, is there a better channel for this discussion other than here and ubuntu?&lt;br/&gt;[23:02] &lt;oerheks&gt; this channel is fine&lt;br/&gt;[23:02] &lt;Juest&gt; the buildd folder says: These are not general-purpose images and their usage is not supported outside of Multipass or Launchpad. Bugs found on those platforms should be filed in the cloud-images project on Launchpad.net.&lt;br/&gt;[23:03] &lt;oerheks&gt; jups, as regular update issue&lt;br/&gt;[23:03] &lt;Juest&gt; oh hmm, i see&lt;br/&gt;[23:04] &lt;Juest&gt; ah so its only supported in rolling update scenarios?&lt;br/&gt;[23:05] &lt;oerheks&gt; one can see this as rolling, which is not true, still holding on to stable packages for lts&lt;br/&gt;[23:05] &lt;Juest&gt; yeah i understand that, sorry for the misnomer&lt;br/&gt;[23:05] &lt;oerheks&gt; just bug fixes, not new features&lt;br/&gt;[23:05] &lt;oerheks&gt; no, your question is valid.&lt;br/&gt;[23:05] &lt;Juest&gt; hence why i said rolling updates not release&lt;br/&gt;[23:06] &lt;Juest&gt; a rolling model for updates not for releases which the latter is more popular/common&lt;br/&gt;[23:06] &lt;oerheks&gt; i used to wanna run latest, but i am back to solid lts&lt;br/&gt;[23:06] &lt;Juest&gt; ah interesting&lt;br/&gt;[23:06] &lt;oerheks&gt; 22.04 for now&lt;br/&gt;[23:06] &lt;Juest&gt; hey at least its the little corner to chat with ubuntu people outside of the support channels :D&lt;br/&gt;[23:07] &lt;Juest&gt; appreciate the attention and time ^^&lt;br/&gt;[23:07] &lt;oerheks&gt; sometimes it is minutes, sometimes it takes a year to meet and greet, Juest &lt;br/&gt;[23:07] &lt;Juest&gt; true&lt;br/&gt;[23:07] &lt;oerheks&gt; have fun!&lt;br/&gt;[23:07] &lt;Juest&gt; nice to meet you likewise&lt;br/&gt;[23:08] &lt;Juest&gt; hmmmm just remained thinking....&lt;br/&gt;[23:08] &lt;oerheks&gt; in shortl; i love a good argument&lt;br/&gt;[23:09] &lt;Juest&gt; oh btw i got the ubuntu installation booted in a isolated container with systemd init with success on connecting to systemd through a chroot after entering the namespace&lt;br/&gt;[23:09] &lt;Juest&gt; on a different non-systemd distro&lt;br/&gt;[23:09] &lt;sarnold&gt; wow :)&lt;br/&gt;[23:09] &lt;sarnold&gt; I thought that sounded like a pretty good challenge&lt;br/&gt;[23:09] &lt;Juest&gt; but im facing permission issues when it comes to processes creating a user namespace&lt;br/&gt;[23:09] &lt;Juest&gt; yeah it was sarnold :)&lt;br/&gt;[23:10] &lt;oerheks&gt; i read the suggestions of phogg and tingo&lt;br/&gt;[23:11] &lt;hwpplayer1&gt; sarnold: Can I pm you :&lt;br/&gt;[23:11] &lt;oerheks&gt;  still not sure it can be done&lt;br/&gt;[23:11] &lt;Juest&gt; the better help came from the #systemd channel :)&lt;br/&gt;[23:11] &lt;Juest&gt; it can be done, you just have to be careful and mount everything correctly&lt;br/&gt;[23:11] &lt;oerheks&gt; yes, but there are 2 parts missing something.&lt;br/&gt;[23:11] &lt;Juest&gt; oh? which?&lt;br/&gt;[23:13] &lt;Juest&gt; the issue is that if i use a isolated user namespace there's no privileges, causing cgroups to fail to be created, and basically no users other than the root mapping&lt;br/&gt;[23:14] &lt;oerheks&gt; therefore one cannot mount anything in it.. yet&lt;br/&gt;[23:14] &lt;Juest&gt; something i wasnt doing before is making brand new mounts for /dev (shm, pts), and /run and /tmp&lt;br/&gt;[23:15] &lt;Juest&gt; the mount issue is fixed by adding --mount-proc, and the privileges can be partially resolved by mapping root to have privileges&lt;br/&gt;[23:15] &lt;Juest&gt; oerheks: you drop in a shell, do the necessary mounts and exec systemd and that works&lt;br/&gt;[23:15] &lt;oerheks&gt; there must be a trick, avoiding or capsulation of namespace&lt;br/&gt;[23:16] &lt;oerheks&gt; no idea, this goes over my heas :-D&lt;br/&gt;[23:16] &lt;Juest&gt; only ipc, pid, mount and uts are isolated&lt;br/&gt;[23:17] &lt;Juest&gt; before i was doing -i&lt;args&gt; instead of each separate namespace spec&lt;br/&gt;[23:17] &lt;Juest&gt; so thats one part of the issue lol&lt;br/&gt;[23:17] &lt;Juest&gt; anyways&lt;br/&gt;[23:18] &lt;oerheks&gt;  each separate namespace spec .. ? from host and vm ?&lt;br/&gt;[23:18] &lt;Juest&gt; this is not a vm&lt;br/&gt;[23:18] &lt;oerheks&gt; a backup&lt;br/&gt;[23:18] &lt;Juest&gt; nor runc based&lt;br/&gt;[23:18] &lt;Juest&gt; its a full-on linux partition install of ubuntu that i have&lt;br/&gt;[23:18] &lt;Juest&gt; im doing this method because i dont want to reboot the whole computer to perform updates&lt;br/&gt;[23:19] &lt;sarnold&gt; hwpplayer1: sure&lt;br/&gt;[23:19] &lt;oerheks&gt; you made a genuine copy, now trying to keep it updated, without systemd involved, i understand&lt;br/&gt;[23:19] &lt;Juest&gt; and the reason why chroot doesnt cut it is because i need the systemd stack to run snapd socket properly for the sake of running snap refresh&lt;br/&gt;[23:20] &lt;Juest&gt; oerheks: its not a copy lol, just a ubuntu installation that actually can boot on the same computer without issues :)&lt;br/&gt;[23:20] &lt;Juest&gt; im not trying to kexec (replace the booted system) nor use more resources through virtualization or container runtimes&lt;br/&gt;[23:20] &lt;oerheks&gt; ai, snap refresh.. time to run your own snap mirror&lt;br/&gt;[23:21] &lt;Juest&gt; the problem is that snap cannot connect to snapd&lt;br/&gt;[23:21] &lt;oerheks&gt; that gives double security&lt;br/&gt;[23:21] &lt;Juest&gt; also because of the chroot and not mounting /tmp, /dev, /run i have data in the partition on those folders lol&lt;br/&gt;[23:22] &lt;Juest&gt; heh, fun idea&lt;br/&gt;[23:23] &lt;Juest&gt; i was seeing issues where systemd sockets couldn't be reachable because it was a incoming private connection from a unknown client therefore not allowing it&lt;br/&gt;[23:23] &lt;Juest&gt; to enter the environment outside of the unshare shell once systemd is executed i have to chroot inside after running nsenter&lt;br/&gt;[23:24] &lt;oerheks&gt; sudo journalctl --no-pager -u snapd&lt;br/&gt;[23:24] &lt;oerheks&gt; https://snapcraft.io/docs/fix-common-issues&lt;br/&gt;[23:24] &lt;sarnold&gt; Juest: hah, that sounds right&lt;br/&gt;[23:24] &lt;Juest&gt; now i am correctly able to connect to systemd&lt;br/&gt;[23:24] &lt;oerheks&gt; yes, supposed so&lt;br/&gt;[23:24] &lt;Juest&gt; but the problem is that units do not have permission to use the user namespace&lt;br/&gt;[23:25] &lt;oerheks&gt; so you need to, snapd ?&lt;br/&gt;[23:25] &lt;oerheks&gt; err, question is: do you need to?&lt;br/&gt;[23:25] &lt;Juest&gt; oerheks: yes, i want to get snapd up and running because its required by snap to do any operations&lt;br/&gt;[23:26] &lt;sarnold&gt; lxd can get 'ubuntu' things working in containers, so there's got to be a way for you to construct a similar enough environment by hand&lt;br/&gt;[23:26] &lt;Juest&gt; the whole reason im into this is because i wanted to do snap refresh&lt;br/&gt;[23:26] &lt;Juest&gt; sarnold: sure, maybe i could get somewhere with lxc, im not using lxd because its not light&lt;br/&gt;[23:26] &lt;Juest&gt; i have lxc but im not sure how to tell it to containerize a entire partition and boot that&lt;br/&gt;[23:27] &lt;Juest&gt; doing a volume sounds very risky because it could wipe it&lt;br/&gt;[23:27] &lt;sarnold&gt; tar it up, ask it to boot the tarball? copy over the changed files by hand?&lt;br/&gt;[23:27] &lt;Juest&gt; i dont have storage for that&lt;br/&gt;[23:28] &lt;Juest&gt; i feel more comfortable with the unshare "example utility"&lt;br/&gt;[23:31] &lt;Juest&gt; okay im back to the same issue&lt;br/&gt;[23:31] &lt;Juest&gt; failed to get properties: transport endpoint is not connected&lt;br/&gt;[23:32] &lt;Juest&gt; hmmmm&lt;br/&gt;[23:32] &lt;Juest&gt; oh well&lt;br/&gt;[23:33] &lt;Juest&gt; oh lol i forgot to enter in the pid namespace&lt;br/&gt;[23:33] &lt;sarnold&gt; Juest: maybe run dmesg -w ...&lt;br/&gt;[23:33] &lt;sarnold&gt; doorbell&lt;br/&gt;[23:33] &lt;oerheks&gt; food?&lt;br/&gt;[23:34] &lt;oerheks&gt; 01:33 here&lt;br/&gt;[23:34] &lt;oerheks&gt; oops security&lt;br/&gt;[23:35] &lt;Juest&gt; oh lol&lt;br/&gt;[23:35] &lt;Juest&gt; sarnold: i forgot to enter in the systemd namespace, i was in the unshare namespace instead :P&lt;br/&gt;[23:36] &lt;oerheks&gt; hostname should not be of importance, unless ssh certs?&lt;br/&gt;[23:36] &lt;Juest&gt; issue now is dns resolver&lt;br/&gt;[23:39] &lt;Juest&gt; okay&lt;br/&gt;[23:39] &lt;Juest&gt; networkmanager has limited connectivity&lt;br/&gt;[23:39] &lt;Juest&gt; hmmmmm&lt;br/&gt;[23:39] &lt;Juest&gt; oh well&lt;br/&gt;[23:39] &lt;Juest&gt; oerheks, sarnold, where would it be preferred to discuss this in?&lt;br/&gt;[23:47] &lt;sarnold&gt; Juest: aha, awesome! hard to know, maybe someone else in #ubuntu would have more ideas, but namespacing is kind of a security-ish thing? maybe #lxcontainers would have folks with more direct container experience? this is probably fine&lt;br/&gt;[23:47] &lt;sarnold&gt; oerheks: heh, a new exercise bike&lt;br/&gt;[23:48] &lt;Juest&gt; :D&lt;br/&gt;[23:48] &lt;Juest&gt; i see&lt;br/&gt;[23:48] &lt;Juest&gt; well, its related because the target is a ubuntu system :P&lt;br/&gt;[23:49] &lt;Juest&gt; you mean #lxc maybe?&lt;br/&gt;[23:50] &lt;Juest&gt; i guess that #linux is fine as well&lt;br/&gt;[23:51] &lt;oerheks&gt; sure, post on stack&lt;br/&gt;[23:51] &lt;Juest&gt; another little issue, it seems the gui started up but i dont see it, i should check the console&lt;br/&gt;[23:55] &lt;Juest&gt; well&lt;br/&gt;[23:55] &lt;Juest&gt; im having a issue refreshing the snap&lt;br/&gt;[23:56] &lt;Juest&gt; ill check the link&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;# UBUNTU-MEETING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[06:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; didrocks joalif slyon cpaelzer jamespage: here is the (hopefully you agree) trivial MIR that I mentioned will come https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/isa-support/+bug/2073895 . due to the expected virtual sprint and debconf downtime for many I'm reaching out here to maybe get it reviewed before two more weeks pass&lt;br/&gt;[06:43] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2073895 in isa-support (Ubuntu) "[MIR] isa-support" [Undecided, New]&lt;br/&gt;=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk&lt;br/&gt;=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk&lt;br/&gt;=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk&lt;br/&gt;=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk&lt;br/&gt;=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk&lt;br/&gt;=== ahasenack__ is now known as ahasenack&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">24.07.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>23.07.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</title><description># UBUNTU-SECURITY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=== chris14_ is now known as chris14&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;# UBUNTU-MEETING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk&lt;br/&gt;=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk&lt;br/&gt;=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk&lt;br/&gt;=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk&lt;br/&gt;=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk&lt;br/&gt;[14:29] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; huhu&lt;br/&gt;[14:30] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status&lt;br/&gt;[14:30] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting started at 14:30:29 UTC.

I'm not aware that we've approved many (any?) PPU for core packages such as these.&lt;br/&gt;[16:12] &lt;rbasak&gt; So one question for the DMB: is PPU appropriate for these packages at all?&lt;br/&gt;[16:13] &lt;rbasak&gt; Second question: I appreciate mkukri documenting the very special publication process for these packages in his application. But, don't these need AA approval to land? I see no endorsements from AAs who have reviewed these.&lt;br/&gt;[16:14] &lt;teward&gt; I think the reason we consider things "core" is why Core Developer exists.  On the sole basis that one wrong move on these core packages, and there can be major problems.&lt;br/&gt;[16:14] &lt;rbasak&gt; juliank's endorsement says: "Given the way these updates are published with external signing PPAs, and Mate already having access to request signing and unembargo those we already trust him arguably more than the PPU" - so what's the story there? Has an AA already granted mkukri some level of access for these?&lt;br/&gt;[16:14] &lt;mkukri&gt; i believe the signing is done via ~canonical-signing-jobs and a private signing PPA. i have submitted many signing requests myself via that&lt;br/&gt;[16:15] &lt;mkukri&gt; i think after that the packages get binary copied to the archive. i am not aware of extra AA approval after that, but i could be wrong (as obviously those copies were dont by juliank to this point)&lt;br/&gt;[16:15] &lt;teward&gt; I agree with Robie, wouldn't that binary copy need special AA handling?&lt;br/&gt;[16:15] &lt;rbasak&gt; So on my second question, I'm not comfortable approving PPU without an AA coming along and agreeing that this makes sense to do, and that they're happy with mkukri's handling of the special process in terms of review submissions, etc.&lt;br/&gt;[16:16] &lt;rbasak&gt; I know that special AA handling is required for SRUs. I'm not sure about the development release.&lt;br/&gt;[16:16] &lt;rbasak&gt; It may be that it isn't required, but I think it should be regardless!&lt;br/&gt;[16:17] &lt;bdrung&gt; I looked at https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+publishinghistory as an example. I see entries like "Copied from ubuntu oracular in Ubuntu UEFI build PPA by Julian Andres Klode"&lt;br/&gt;[16:18] &lt;mkukri&gt; grub2 isnt signed&lt;br/&gt;[16:18] &lt;rbasak&gt; If it's going via the unapproved queue (whether for source or binaries) then my understanding of Launchpad's model is that it would say that regardless. I don't know of a publicly accessible audit log of queue accepts.&lt;br/&gt;[16:18] &lt;mkukri&gt; the signed ones are copied from here https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-uefi-team/+archive/ubuntu/proposed-public&lt;br/&gt;[16:19] &lt;rbasak&gt; How would the other DMB members like to proceed?&lt;br/&gt;[16:20] &lt;schopin&gt; Regarding the first question, I think it's similar to the kernel, both in terms of the huge impact it can have but also the very specific expert knowledge needed.&lt;br/&gt;[16:21] &lt;schopin&gt; You don't need to understand how to handle library transitions to be a good maintainer of the boot stack, and the SRU process for it is very specific.&lt;br/&gt;[16:21] &lt;rbasak&gt; The kernel has an advantage that it is well abstracted from everything else though. With these packages there are deep interactions that extend well beyond these packages.&lt;br/&gt;[16:22] &lt;rbasak&gt; So no need to understand library transitions, no, but I get the impression differently deep packaging knowledge is needed.&lt;br/&gt;[16:22] &lt;schopin&gt; Just for context later on, we're talking about the following packages: grub2, grub2-unsigned, grub2-signed, shim, shim-signed, ubuntu-boot-test, python-uefivars, efivar, efibootmgr&lt;br/&gt;[16:23] &lt;bdrung&gt; rbasak, do we have a list of PPU sets and which contain packages from main?&lt;br/&gt;[16:23] &lt;rbasak&gt; I can't think of a way to extract that quickly unfortunately.&lt;br/&gt;[16:25] &lt;bdrung&gt; rbasak, do you have the reference to all PPU sets that we have?&lt;br/&gt;[16:25] &lt;rbasak&gt; The best way I think think of is to iterate over ~ubuntu-dev and/or ~ubuntu-uploaders and run edit-acl over each person.&lt;br/&gt;[16:26] &lt;rbasak&gt; For packagesets we have https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/packagesets/&lt;br/&gt;[16:26] &lt;rbasak&gt; But that doesn't cover PPU&lt;br/&gt;[16:26] &lt;rbasak&gt; There's no concept of a "PPU set". Just what individual ACLs have been granted to individuals.&lt;br/&gt;[16:27] &lt;bdrung&gt; thanks. bookmarked. With "PPU set" I meant more or less package sets - or the superset of package sets and individual PPUs.&lt;br/&gt;[16:29] &lt;schopin&gt; rbasak: I fail to understand how these packages have that much more interactions with the rest of the system than the kernel, really.&lt;br/&gt;[16:29] &lt;rbasak&gt; The only recent "core" type package we granted PPU to was livecd-rootfs. In that case I was also doubtful about the appropriateness to grant it to a non-core-dev, and asked for a peer review commitment from a core dev in mitigation, which was agreed. However I was later pressured to retract that request.&lt;br/&gt;[16:29] &lt;teward&gt; rbasak: pressured from where?&lt;br/&gt;[16:29] &lt;rbasak&gt; I can't think of any other relevant existing permissions.&lt;br/&gt;[16:30] &lt;rbasak&gt; teward: by other Ubuntu developers, privately, who thought it was an unreasonable "restriction" given that the DMB had agreed that this person could have PPU to livecd-rootfs.&lt;br/&gt;[16:30] &lt;rbasak&gt; However it wasn't formally a restriction by the DMB in my understanding - just a request.&lt;br/&gt;[16:32] &lt;rbasak&gt; schopin: well for example I had a long discussion with mkukri and others recently about bug 1635181. That to me is a complex packaging interaction with cloud images.&lt;br/&gt;[16:32] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 1635181 in grub2 (Ubuntu) "Curtin sneaks config into /etc/default/grub.d/" [Undecided, Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1635181&lt;br/&gt;[16:33] &lt;rbasak&gt; schopin: usually PPU has been for leaf packages where if a PPU uploader were to make a decision about that kind of bug, it wouldn't impact anything but the users of that leaf package.&lt;br/&gt;[16:33] &lt;mkukri&gt; i cannot disagree with the "complex interactions" thing either&lt;br/&gt;[16:33] &lt;rbasak&gt; But here, decisions made there would have much wider reach - to every cloud user.&lt;br/&gt;[16:34] &lt;teward&gt; and with the requested set in this request, *every* user&lt;br/&gt;[16:34] &lt;teward&gt; cloud or otherwise (just putting that as a point of statement/fact)&lt;br/&gt;[16:34] &lt;rbasak&gt; To be clear, I'm not judging mkukri's abilities here. My interactions with him have been excellent.&lt;br/&gt;[16:35] &lt;rbasak&gt; But the *principle* of granting PPU at all for "core" packages is what I'm questioning. It wouldn't be a "leaf" activity like it is for regular PPU requests.&lt;br/&gt;[16:36] &lt;schopin&gt; I'm not saying there aren't complex interactions, mind you, it's just the kernel comparison that strike me.&lt;br/&gt;[16:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; I think the DMB needs to decide whether PPU for these packages is suitable at all, or not.&lt;br/&gt;[16:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; I think I'm still willing to be persuaded otherwise. I do think it's a problem that needs addressing.&lt;br/&gt;[16:38] &lt;rbasak&gt; As developers are getting more specialised within Canonical now, we're getting PPU requests whereas previously they'd just have become core devs without particuarly setting out to achieve that just because their work was more broad.&lt;br/&gt;[16:38] &lt;schopin&gt; Is it a decision that can be taken by the DMB though?&lt;br/&gt;[16:38] &lt;rbasak&gt; I think so&lt;br/&gt;[16:38] &lt;bdrung&gt; I looked for similar cases in https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/packagesets/oracular/ that could be an argument for core package PPUs, but found none except the kernel case.&lt;br/&gt;[16:39] &lt;rbasak&gt; It's up to the DMB to decide whether to grant PPU or not. If the DMB were to decide that some packages aren't suitable to ever have PPU, then from a governance perspective I think that would be valid.&lt;br/&gt;[16:39] &lt;teward&gt; based on my understanding of the layout of the permissions, DMB is given the task to decide on membership rights, etc. including what packages we can grant individual PPUs on or not.  Since it's a delegated permission from the TB to the DMB.  That's my understanding of the delegation&lt;br/&gt;[16:39] &lt;teward&gt; (and therefore governance)&lt;br/&gt;[16:39] &lt;teward&gt; s/permissions/delegation of powers/&lt;br/&gt;[16:39] &lt;mkukri&gt; i think for the early boot part, the kernel is the best comparison. for the complex collection of arcane userspace scripts and utilities, there is probably none&lt;br/&gt;[16:40] &lt;rbasak&gt; Another view might be that for core packages, we expect candidates to have a wide set of experience over the archive, and therefore it's reasonable and we actually _want_ applicants to have "done the rounds" before applying. I realise that this imposes some more work, but I don't think it'd be a bad thing.&lt;br/&gt;[16:41] &lt;rbasak&gt; mkukri: unfortunately I see the packages as a combination of both.&lt;br/&gt;[16:41] &lt;rbasak&gt; mkukri: if you were to need to patch the upstream code to fix a bug, then I think your application makes it clear that it'd be appropriate for you to upload without requiring further core dev review.&lt;br/&gt;[16:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; mkukri: but the packaging has complexity beyond that, with very widespread ramifications, which arguably should be reviewed by someone with wide experience. Which could be you, but that would require a core dev application to demonstrate.&lt;br/&gt;[16:43] &lt;mkukri&gt; i am not disputing the fact the grub uploads need review, i think grub uploads by coredevs should *also* be reviewed by at least another person&lt;br/&gt;[16:44] &lt;rbasak&gt; Ideas have been floated around an alternative path which focuses on peer review rather than granting access to individuals to upload subsets of the archive "without supervision", which is what the ACLs we have today do.&lt;br/&gt;[16:44] &lt;rbasak&gt; I really like the idea but don't have the capacity to drive it right now :-/&lt;br/&gt;[16:45] &lt;rbasak&gt; So how do we proceed?&lt;br/&gt;[16:45] &lt;rbasak&gt; I think it'd be nice to have DMB consensus on this point, rather than doing it piecemeal through votes on every PPU application.&lt;br/&gt;[16:45] &lt;rbasak&gt; So I can start a thread on the ML I guess?&lt;br/&gt;[16:46] &lt;schopin&gt; Yes, I think deferring to the ML would be best.&lt;br/&gt;[16:46] &lt;bdrung&gt; I haven't made up my mind about whether or not DMB should grant PPU rights on core package or not.&lt;br/&gt;[16:46] &lt;rbasak&gt; However, if you want to proceed anyway, I would not stop you (but my vote would be -1 for the reasons above - nothing to do with mkukri's application itself, but that I see this as a new category of request for which we do not have consensus on how to handle)&lt;br/&gt;[16:48] &lt;bdrung&gt; We should agree on granting / not granting PPU rights on core package before discussing mkukri's application&lt;br/&gt;[16:48] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK, so let me start an ML thread, and then I guess we'll need to defer reviewing mkukri's application until after either 1) we've reached consensus; or 2) DMB members want to skip that and move to a vote regardless. I favour the former, to be clear; I'm just making sure to state the latter option to make sure that there's no doubt from a governance perspective.&lt;br/&gt;[16:49] &lt;rbasak&gt; Does that sound OK to everyone?&lt;br/&gt;[16:49] &lt;bdrung&gt; yes&lt;br/&gt;[16:49] &lt;schopin&gt; Yes.&lt;br/&gt;[16:50] &lt;rbasak&gt; #action rbasak to start a ML thread to find consensus on whether to allow PPU applications for "core" packages&lt;br/&gt;[16:50] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: rbasak to start a ML thread to find consensus on whether to allow PPU applications for "core" packages&lt;br/&gt;[16:50] &lt;rbasak&gt; Sorry mkukri that we couldn't handle your request in this meeting.&lt;br/&gt;[16:50] &lt;rbasak&gt; #topic Outstanding mailing list requests to assign&lt;br/&gt;[16:50] &lt;bdrung&gt; i'll have a comment for mkukri. let me write it down.&lt;br/&gt;[16:51] &lt;rbasak&gt; mkukri: on my second question above, I wonder if you could please get an endorsement from an AA who has handled your uploads? I know that they do for SRUs at least. That would give me confidence in a future review of your application.&lt;br/&gt;[16:52] &lt;rbasak&gt; schopin: the "DMB Meeting hours revision" thread looks like it's still outstanding. Are you planning to drive that?&lt;br/&gt;[16:52] &lt;schopin&gt; Depending on the process, mkukri might not *know* which AA handled his upload.&lt;br/&gt;[16:52] &lt;rbasak&gt; Indeed.&lt;br/&gt;[16:52] &lt;mkukri&gt; i have had essentially zero personalized interaction with AAs despite having produced almost all the GRUB uploads in ubuntu over the last ~11 months. beyond regular SRU review i am not entirely sure about their part in this to be perfectly honest&lt;br/&gt;[16:52] &lt;rbasak&gt; But he has colleagues who can help him figure that out :)&lt;br/&gt;[16:53] &lt;rbasak&gt; mkukri: it was probably the SRU team members who are also AAs who accepted your SRU into -proposed and made that initial template bug comment&lt;br/&gt;[16:54] &lt;schopin&gt; He does, but it seems weird to require endorsement from them in these circumstances.&lt;br/&gt;[16:54] &lt;rbasak&gt; I don't see any other outstanding ML threads.&lt;br/&gt;[16:54] &lt;mkukri&gt; i think there is a major bottleneck in the SRU process w.r.t grub, and we have even complained about this on the ML&lt;br/&gt;[16:54] &lt;mkukri&gt; it seems like essentially no one besides vorlon touches shim/grub srus&lt;br/&gt;[16:54] &lt;schopin&gt; rbasak: re the Hours thing, I was hoping I'd get more input, especially from bdmurray given his TZ.&lt;br/&gt;[16:55] &lt;schopin&gt; I'll try nudging the ball forward.&lt;br/&gt;[16:55] &lt;rbasak&gt; Thanks!&lt;br/&gt;[16:55] &lt;rbasak&gt; I wrote up https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates/Grub after a discussion with Steve&lt;br/&gt;[16:55] &lt;rbasak&gt; However I cannot do any more without documentation or training from someone who does know the process.&lt;br/&gt;[16:56] &lt;bdrung&gt; mkukri, I looked at https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bpftrace/+bug/2073485 this morning and at https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bpftrace/+bug/2060766 from your application.

The risk is that there are other code paths not being exercised that will continue to fail I suppose, but it might be reasonable to wait for such a bug report before deciding to go fully unconfined.&lt;br/&gt;[13:27] &lt;rbasak&gt; OTOH if we have a few examples of where the confinement is a problem in other cases, then that would provide some justification towards dropping the confinement altogether across these packages.&lt;br/&gt;[13:28] &lt;rbasak&gt; Perhaps that will help make a decision? If the security team reaches a (documented) conclusion of the preferred path with sgmoore in the bug, then I see no reason why the SRU team would want to do something different.&lt;br/&gt;[13:30] &lt;jjohansen&gt; rbasak: dropping confinement is going to be really problematic going forward. unconfined profiles are just a temporary place holder as well. Those will get transitioned to real profiles&lt;br/&gt;[13:31] &lt;jjohansen&gt; multiarch is looser than we like but it will get tightened. Fixing conditionals so they can be applied to variables is on the todo list&lt;br/&gt;[13:32] &lt;jjohansen&gt; then multiarch will be able to be specific to distro and even runtime platform&lt;br/&gt;[13:36] &lt;jjohansen&gt; for the SRU:&lt;br/&gt;[13:36] &lt;jjohansen&gt; - new profiles can be flags=(unconfined)&lt;br/&gt;[13:36] &lt;jjohansen&gt; - new profiles should have a non-path based name, and the attachment can use the multiarch var&lt;br/&gt;[13:36] &lt;jjohansen&gt; - existing profiles should just be adjusted to use multiarch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;# UBUNTU-MEETING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[14:30] &lt;sarnold&gt; good morning&lt;br/&gt;[14:30] &lt;didrocks&gt; hey!&lt;br/&gt;[14:30] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; uh, tuesday&lt;br/&gt;[14:30] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; getting ready&lt;br/&gt;[14:31] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status&lt;br/&gt;[14:31] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting started at 14:31:20 UTC.

Does anyone have questions for the applicant?&lt;br/&gt;[19:07] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; \o&lt;br/&gt;[19:07] &lt;rbasak&gt; zhsj: o/&lt;br/&gt;[19:08] &lt;rbasak&gt; zhsj: do you have an example of an SRU that you've done that contains a regression analysis please?&lt;br/&gt;[19:09] &lt;zhsj&gt; zhsj: i didn't do many SRU, and no regression so far. so unfortunately i can't give your an example&lt;br/&gt;[19:09] &lt;zhsj&gt; rbasak:&lt;br/&gt;[19:11] &lt;zhsj&gt; but for regression about SRU, the process is documented at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates#Regressions&lt;br/&gt;[19:11] &lt;rbasak&gt; No, that's not what I'm asking&lt;br/&gt;[19:11] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm asking about "Where problems could occur" from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates#Procedure&lt;br/&gt;[19:12] &lt;zhsj&gt; ok.&lt;br/&gt;[19:12] &lt;rbasak&gt; Could you show an example of where you have been thoughtful about what problems might have occurred, and adjusted the test plan accordingly, for example?&lt;br/&gt;[19:12] &lt;zhsj&gt; so for https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gobject-introspection/+bug/2065902&lt;br/&gt;[19:12] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2065902 in libkkc (Ubuntu Noble) "libkkc FTBFS on noble: can't resolve libraries to shared libraries: m" [Undecided, Triaged]&lt;br/&gt;[19:12] &lt;zhsj&gt; and https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/llvm-toolchain-18/+bug/2064187&lt;br/&gt;[19:12] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2064187 in llvm-toolchain-18 (Ubuntu Oracular) "llvm-18-linker-tools does not include LLVMgold.so" [Undecided, Fix Released]&lt;br/&gt;[19:12] &lt;rbasak&gt; I don't think an FTBFS fix really allows to show a good example of that unfortunately.&lt;br/&gt;[19:12] &lt;zhsj&gt; maybe the second one&lt;br/&gt;[19:13] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'd like to see an example of a more "regular" SRU where you're changing code paths that users are already using&lt;br/&gt;[19:13] &lt;rbasak&gt; I don't think bug 2064187 is a good example of a quality SRU submission.&lt;br/&gt;[19:13] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2064187 in llvm-toolchain-18 (Ubuntu Oracular) "llvm-18-linker-tools does not include LLVMgold.so" [Undecided, Fix Released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2064187&lt;br/&gt;[19:14] &lt;zhsj&gt; i see. but as i said in my application, i hope i can do more SRU in the future&lt;br/&gt;[19:14] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK. Next, do you have any examples of doing Ubuntu package merges?&lt;br/&gt;[19:15] &lt;zhsj&gt; yes, i have listed the merges on my applications on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/zhsj/CoreDeveloperApplication#Examples_of_my_work_.2F_Things_I.27m_proud_of&lt;br/&gt;[19:15] &lt;rbasak&gt; The "Merge" section in your application page seems to refer to merge proposals in Launchpad, rather than the Ubuntu "package merge" process which is a bit more specific.&lt;br/&gt;[19:16] &lt;zhsj&gt; ha, but when we doing merges with git-ubuntu, merge proposal are more nature&lt;br/&gt;[19:16] &lt;rbasak&gt; Sure. I just want to see examples&lt;br/&gt;[19:16] &lt;rbasak&gt; I found https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/runc/1.1.12+ds1-2ubuntu1 but that was sponsored by kanashiro who didn't endorse you&lt;br/&gt;[19:17] &lt;zhsj&gt; do you mean merge with m-o-m?&lt;br/&gt;[19:17] &lt;rbasak&gt; I don't care how it's done. I just want to see examples of you doing it well.&lt;br/&gt;[19:17] &lt;zhsj&gt; yeah, i didn't ask everyone who only sponsors once to endorse&lt;br/&gt;[19:18] &lt;zhsj&gt; actually the runc one is through git-ubuntu iirc, i send the git patch to kanashiro&lt;br/&gt;[19:20] &lt;rbasak&gt; I found https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kmod/30+20230601-2ubuntu1 https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kmod/31+20240202-2ubuntu1 https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/runc/1.1.12+ds1-2ubuntu1 and https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libgcrypt20/1.10.2-3ubuntu1, going backwards in history. The oldest there was sponsored by me.&lt;br/&gt;[19:21] &lt;rbasak&gt; The others were Dan, Nick and Lucas, none of whom have endorsed your application (and nor was I asked).&lt;br/&gt;[19:21] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I think he explained why he didn't ask people who only sponsored one thing&lt;br/&gt;[19:22] &lt;rbasak&gt; Unfortunately it means that nobody is speaking to his ability to do an entire category of work that is important to be an Ubuntu uploader at all.&lt;br/&gt;[19:22] &lt;rbasak&gt; zhsj: have you driven any transitions in Ubuntu?&lt;br/&gt;[19:23] &lt;bdmurray&gt; What would you like to seen then rbasak? Him to have multiple merges sponsored by multiple devs so they all feel comfortable endorsing him?&lt;br/&gt;[19:23] &lt;rbasak&gt; I have detailed my expectations at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RobieBasak/DMB/CoreDev&lt;br/&gt;[19:23] &lt;zhsj&gt; i only drive the uncommon transitions in ubuntu, like every golang-default transition.&lt;br/&gt;[19:23] &lt;rbasak&gt; The last paragraph is relevant here I think.&lt;br/&gt;[19:24] &lt;zhsj&gt; but i have driven c library transition in debian&lt;br/&gt;[19:25] &lt;rbasak&gt; zhsj: have you touched any seeds? How well do you understand how seeds work?&lt;br/&gt;[19:25] &lt;zhsj&gt; i didn't touch seed yet.&lt;br/&gt;[19:25] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; zhsj: What drove your decision to apply directly to be a Core Developer instead of MOTU or PPU as a first step?&lt;br/&gt;[19:26] &lt;teward&gt; tsimonq2: get the hell out of my head i was just typing that&lt;br/&gt;[19:26] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; teward: ;)&lt;br/&gt;[19:26] &lt;zhsj&gt; tsimonq2: for PPU, i write in my application that i'm interested in all golang packages, which is more than 2k packages.&lt;br/&gt;[19:27] &lt;zhsj&gt; tsimonq2: for MOTU, because i also doing work like merges for many main packages.&lt;br/&gt;[19:28] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; zhsj: What is the difference between packages in Main vs Universe?&lt;br/&gt;[19:29] &lt;zhsj&gt; tsimonq2: the most difference is who can upload them and who is responsible for them. for main packages, canonical is committed to maintain it&lt;br/&gt;[19:29] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; zhsj: How would you ask for a Universe package to be put into Main?&lt;br/&gt;[19:30] &lt;zhsj&gt; the process is called MIR&lt;br/&gt;[19:30] &lt;zhsj&gt; it's documented at https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/blob/main/README.md&lt;br/&gt;[19:31] &lt;rbasak&gt; There's one MIR he's done that's documented on his application: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcpcd/+bug/2019191&lt;br/&gt;[19:31] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2019191 in dhcpcd (Ubuntu) "[MIR] dhcpcd" [Undecided, Fix Released]&lt;br/&gt;[19:31] &lt;bdrung&gt; zhsj, what are the differences for C library transitions between Debian and Ubuntu?&lt;br/&gt;[19:31] &lt;zhsj&gt; rbasak: for seed, my understanding is it's about what will be shipped in ISO&lt;br/&gt;[19:32] &lt;zhsj&gt; bdrung: i think they are mostly same, as both share the same transition tracker. but debian has binNMU process, the corresponding thing for ubuntu is no-change rebuild&lt;br/&gt;[19:33] &lt;zhsj&gt; which is source full upload&lt;br/&gt;[19:33] &lt;bdrung&gt; zhsj, You wrote that if patches are got reviewed more actively, contributors would be more interested in becoming developers. What is your experience regarding sponsoring and did the sponsor time had an influence on becoming an Ubuntu developer?&lt;br/&gt;[19:34] &lt;zhsj&gt; that was my feeling before the restart of patch pilots&lt;br/&gt;[19:35] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm busy writing up my thoughts.&lt;br/&gt;[19:35] &lt;bdrung&gt; zhsj, do you think that the current speed of the sponsor queue (with the patch pilots helping) is fast enough or should still be faster?&lt;br/&gt;[19:36] &lt;zhsj&gt; maybe only my experience with the patch pilots currently, the speed for SRU sponsor is slow&lt;br/&gt;[19:37] &lt;teward&gt; let me be more specific with bdrung's question&lt;br/&gt;[19:37] &lt;teward&gt; Excluding the time it takes for SRUs to actually be processed by the SRU team, is the rest of the sponsorship queue with patch pilots helping fast enough, or should it still be faster?&lt;br/&gt;[19:37] &lt;teward&gt; (CC hat on: There are multiple reasons that the SRU process is slower than standard sponsoring process that go far beyond the scope of DMB discussion, hence why i'm being more specific with the question)&lt;br/&gt;[19:38] &lt;zhsj&gt; yeah, i mean the sponsor time for SRU patch, not the entire process.&lt;br/&gt;[19:38] &lt;teward&gt; just checking ;)&lt;br/&gt;[19:38] &lt;zhsj&gt; it's only personal feeling thought&lt;br/&gt;[19:38] &lt;zhsj&gt; though*&lt;br/&gt;[19:38] &lt;schopin&gt; zhsj: let's say you find that a package is broken beyond repair and should probably be removed from the archive. What would you need to check and how would you go about the removal?&lt;br/&gt;[19:39] &lt;bdrung&gt; looking at http://sponsoring-reports.ubuntu.com/ a lot of old entries are SRUs. So that would bake your feeling.&lt;br/&gt;[19:39] &lt;rbasak&gt; The sponsorship queue is intended to foster community contributions. Canonical employees can "skip" the queue because they have no shortage of colleagues who can sponsor, and an employer who task their employed sponsors with priorities that matter to them. So I'm not sure that zhsj's experience is really representative of what we need from the sponsorship queue and/or patch piloting. In internal&lt;br/&gt;[19:39] &lt;zhsj&gt; schopin: i would check the reverse deps, with the help of tool `reverse-depends`&lt;br/&gt;[19:39] &lt;rbasak&gt; discussions I keep asking about how to stop the big Canonical sponsorships from clogging up the sponsorship queue.&lt;br/&gt;[19:40] &lt;zhsj&gt; schopin: than if nothing blocking, i will file a bug on lp, and subscribe ubuntu archive admin to ask them to remove&lt;br/&gt;[19:40] &lt;rbasak&gt; When we have a moment I have a long post ready to paste.&lt;br/&gt;[19:41] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; rbasak: Go ahead, unless you'd like to wait until after the vote.&lt;br/&gt;[19:42] &lt;zhsj&gt; schopin: and maybe need to block them from sync from debian as well after removal&lt;br/&gt;[19:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; It looks like the work you are doing is excellent. However, your track record seems narrow in scope compared to what I'd expect a core dev to know. In particular, when you become a core dev people look to you to sponsor anything, and this pressure is especially true for Canonical employees. I appreciate the difficulty in getting things sponsored, but equally I also expect core devs to have&lt;br/&gt;[19:42] &lt;zhsj&gt; or if it's broken in debian as well, ask debian to remove as well&lt;br/&gt;[19:43] &lt;rbasak&gt; demonstrated understanding across the wide range of things that core devs are expected to be able to sponsor into the archive.&lt;br/&gt;[19:43] &lt;rbasak&gt; I don't think it's unreasonable to ask Canonical employees seeking core dev to "do the rounds" and get that wide range of experience first. I have documented my expectations and advertised them for long enough that they should be well known to your peers and mentors at Canonical (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RobieBasak/DMB/CoreDev). I've stood for the DMB multiple times on the platform that I stand by&lt;br/&gt;[19:43] &lt;rbasak&gt; these expectations. I think your application falls well short of what I've written there, particularly in the last paragraph.&lt;br/&gt;[19:43] &lt;rbasak&gt; Separately, I regret that we don't have a good process to unblock you _except_ to get core dev. Unfortunately that's a harder problem to solve but I acknowledge that it exists. In the meantime I think that asking you to build up a more comprehensive track record first is reasonable, and get endorsements that can speak to your abilities and understanding _across_ the various different aspects of&lt;br/&gt;[19:43] &lt;rbasak&gt; that. Please see my wiki page of expectations, and let me know if you have any specific questions.&lt;br/&gt;[19:43] &lt;rbasak&gt; Therefore, following my own written criteria, my vote would be -1 and I've seen no reason that an exception is warranted in this case.&lt;br/&gt;[19:43] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm open to feedback / discussion. I understand this is frustrating to hear, including for some others on the DMB. But I really think that my expectations have been clear for years, that it would be better for Ubuntu for applicants from the Canonical Foundations team to simply meet them, and so I think it's appropriate for me to hold the line here. I don't see why it's difficult to meet these&lt;br/&gt;[19:43] &lt;rbasak&gt; expectations.&lt;br/&gt;[19:44] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; out of curiosity, there's no Foundations packageset, no?&lt;br/&gt;[19:44] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; No.&lt;br/&gt;[19:44] &lt;teward&gt; utkarsh2102: no, but Foundations has a dedicated group of sponsors in it&lt;br/&gt;[19:44] &lt;teward&gt; who have coredev&lt;br/&gt;[19:44] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; hm&lt;br/&gt;[19:45] &lt;rbasak&gt; This is probably aimed more at zhsj's colleagues and mentors than at zhsj himself, FWIW. I don't expect zhsj himself to have fully understood my expectations, but his core dev mentors and colleagues certainly should.&lt;br/&gt;[19:45] &lt;rbasak&gt; Unfortunately Foundations work doesn't really fit any packageset except for the '*' packageset&lt;br/&gt;[19:45] &lt;teward&gt; utkarsh2102: we also have to be careful because this would be one of the cases where I would expect there to be a golang packageset specifically for golang stuff&lt;br/&gt;[19:45] &lt;rbasak&gt; (ie. core dev)&lt;br/&gt;[19:45] &lt;bdrung&gt; looking at https://udd.debian.org/cgi-bin/ubuntu-sponsorships.cgi?render=html&amp;sponsor=Benjamin+Drung&amp;sponsor_search=name&amp;sponsoree=Shengjing+Zhu&amp;sponsoree_search=name I should have given my endorsement.&lt;br/&gt;[19:45] &lt;teward&gt; because Foundations includes '*'&lt;br/&gt;[19:45] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Any further questions for zhsj before we move to a vote?&lt;br/&gt;[19:46] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; aah, interesting :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:46] &lt;zhsj&gt; bdrung: i did't ask you because you are on the board, and afraid conflict of interest&lt;br/&gt;[19:46] &lt;rbasak&gt; conflict of interest&gt; FWIW, I don't think that's a conflict of interest&lt;br/&gt;[19:46] &lt;bdrung&gt; me neither. I agree with rbasak&lt;br/&gt;[19:46] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[19:47] &lt;teward&gt; yeah i don't see a CoI here&lt;br/&gt;[19:47] &lt;rbasak&gt; It's good for DMB members to have direct experience of work from applicants.&lt;br/&gt;[19:47] &lt;zhsj&gt; same for tsimonq2 and kanashiro who have sponsored me :/&lt;br/&gt;[19:47] &lt;teward&gt; Simon knows well enough whether to endorse someone or not&lt;br/&gt;[19:47] &lt;bdrung&gt; I did a lot of sync request, because they are quick to do. But on the UDD page there are other sponsoring as well.&lt;br/&gt;[19:48] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; #vote Add Shengjing Zhu to Ubuntu Core Developers&lt;br/&gt;[19:48] &lt;meetingology&gt; Please vote on: Add Shengjing Zhu to Ubuntu Core Developers&lt;br/&gt;[19:48] &lt;meetingology&gt; Public votes can be registered by saying +1, -1 or +0 in channel (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1|-1|+0 #channelname')&lt;br/&gt;[19:48] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; #voters tsimonq2 rbasak bdmurray utkarsh2102 bdrung schopin teward&lt;br/&gt;[19:48] &lt;meetingology&gt; Current voters: bdmurray, bdrung, rbasak, schopin, teward, tsimonq2, utkarsh2102&lt;br/&gt;[19:48] &lt;rbasak&gt; -1 reasons as above&lt;br/&gt;[19:48] &lt;meetingology&gt; -1 reasons as above received from rbasak&lt;br/&gt;[19:49] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; -1 I would like to see more work in Main directly&lt;br/&gt;[19:49] &lt;meetingology&gt; -1 I would like to see more work in Main directly received from tsimonq2&lt;br/&gt;[19:49] &lt;rbasak&gt; Note that I haven't done the usual quizzing on specific knowledge areas like release cycle, milestones and exception process.

So I wanted to make sure I am on DMB officially when I reply to her&lt;br/&gt;[19:59] &lt;rbasak&gt; It's been rotting for years, and nobody trusts it any more. If it would be sorted out, that'd make these requests much easier to handle.&lt;br/&gt;[20:00] &lt;rbasak&gt; And it doesn't need an DMB member to work on that. Only review of code changes and actual execution need to be the DMB.&lt;br/&gt;[20:00] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; since the last meeting, everybody was automatically removed from the board&lt;br/&gt;[20:00] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; including me&lt;br/&gt;[20:00] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; so Mitch's ACL is also left for ubuntu-server packageset&lt;br/&gt;[20:00] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; which I'll do, too&lt;br/&gt;[20:00] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; https://launchpad.net/~developer-membership-board/+members you're still there?&lt;br/&gt;[20:00] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; today&lt;br/&gt;[20:00] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; ah&lt;br/&gt;[20:00] &lt;rbasak&gt; automatically removed&gt; ah, sorry. I didn't think anyone was blocked, else I'd have happily extended people again.&lt;br/&gt;[20:00] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; yes but that's reinstated now, I wasn't a member last and last to last week&lt;br/&gt;[20:01] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; #action Utkarsh to follow up with Scarlett re: Kubuntu packageset updates&lt;br/&gt;[20:01] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: Utkarsh to follow up with Scarlett re: Kubuntu packageset updates&lt;br/&gt;[20:01] &lt;teward&gt; rbasak: what's the script currently written in?&lt;br/&gt;[20:01] &lt;teward&gt; also where's the code&lt;br/&gt;[20:01] &lt;rbasak&gt; Python&lt;br/&gt;[20:01] &lt;rbasak&gt; Looking&lt;br/&gt;[20:01] &lt;teward&gt; so it's just ugly python and needs rewritten xD&lt;br/&gt;[20:01] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; #action Utkarsh to follow up on Mitch's ubuntu-server packageset&lt;br/&gt;[20:01] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: Utkarsh to follow up on Mitch's ubuntu-server packageset&lt;br/&gt;[20:01] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; #topic AOB&lt;br/&gt;[20:01] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; rbasak: I'd be happy to take a look as well.&lt;br/&gt;[20:02] &lt;teward&gt; tsimonq2: i think you and I just volunteered to tackle it xD&lt;br/&gt;[20:02] &lt;teward&gt; yay collaboration!&lt;br/&gt;[20:02] &lt;bdrung&gt; I am not sure if I am interested in seeing this Python code.&lt;br/&gt;[20:02] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; hahahaha&lt;br/&gt;[20:02] &lt;schopin&gt; I don't know about everyone's TZ, but would anyone object to move the earlier time slot 1h earlier? Because asking applicants to attend in the middle of the night is not great.&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; it's 1:30 AM right now for me&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;rbasak&gt; tsimonq2: here it is: https://git.launchpad.net/~developer-membership-board/+git/packageset&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; so def +1 for moving a bit earlier :)&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;teward&gt; actually I would love to move our meeting a bit earlier&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;schopin&gt; utkarsh2102: I was actually thinking of the *other* time slot, sorry :/&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;teward&gt; at least this time slot up&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm running out of time.

if I don't, I have a static IP (not from a big commercial national telco though)&lt;br/&gt;[15:07] &lt;Skia&gt; adrien: the biggest one was about 200k per day, iirc, and most were above 5k&lt;br/&gt;[15:08] &lt;Skia&gt;

I don't think the issue is related to openssl, could be arithmetic unfortunately&lt;br/&gt;[15:17] &lt;adrien&gt; one possibility though is that time offset for the ppc64el test runners is larger than for other machines&lt;br/&gt;[15:18] &lt;juliank&gt; I don't care much about this&lt;br/&gt;[15:18] &lt;juliank&gt; It seems like one of the weird time sync issues and it failing isn't new&lt;br/&gt;[15:18] &lt;schopin&gt; how come that wasn't a regression against openssl?&lt;br/&gt;[15:19] &lt;juliank&gt; Oh well it is new against the openssl&lt;br/&gt;[15:19] &lt;juliank&gt; but still I don't see any openssl issue there&lt;br/&gt;[15:19] &lt;adrien&gt; well, it was working before it seems; and ginggs added a hint&lt;br/&gt;[15:19] &lt;schopin&gt; I think it warrants investigation then.&lt;br/&gt;[15:19] &lt;adrien&gt; I don't see why it would be related to openssl unless there's memory corruption or something I don't understand; I can try to spend some time to investigate during the coming days&lt;br/&gt;[15:20] &lt;juliank&gt;

like more documentation, communication, rules on "how early things should be2&lt;br/&gt;[14:50] &lt;slyon&gt; I was stumbling upon tftp-hpa today, which seemed pretty unmaintainer and would be worth flagging (and poking the server team about ;-) )&lt;br/&gt;[14:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; outch :-)&lt;br/&gt;[14:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; TBH, just do a comment on a bug or create one - the owning team's process (whatever it is in detail) should pick that up&lt;br/&gt;[14:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; If we try to standardize on a tag we just need to convince everybody to care about the tag&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; if a team owns a package they are expected to watch bugs&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so just creating/updating one should do it&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;slyon&gt; true&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;sarnold&gt; but this requires someone to notice the package might be stale&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; And with saying something like that we should also close out #55 for now IMHO&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: true, but unless someone has a magic proposal how to do that ...&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;sarnold&gt;

CC jbicha, didrocks&lt;br/&gt;[14:50] &lt;jbicha&gt; slyon: we definitely need some pulseaudio stuff in main, it's being handled (hopefully today)&lt;br/&gt;[14:51] &lt;slyon&gt; jbicha: oh, good to know! So binaries were demoted by accident?&lt;br/&gt;[14:51] &lt;jbicha&gt; I haven't been able to find any logs that explain how some binaries got demoted everywhere but on armhf&lt;br/&gt;[14:51] &lt;sarnold&gt; does anyone else see a need for a more packager-oriented guide? or is the current review documentation sufficient for the task, if not ideal?&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;slyon&gt; sarnold: I wonder if this could be one section of the new packaging-guide? cc dviererbe&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; jbicha: thanks, we'll wait for what you find then&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: I wanted to write the same&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;sarnold&gt; I don't intend for us to solve this today ;) but I just thought I'd put the idea out there, to see if anyone else sees this, or may see this over the course of the cycle&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;jbicha&gt; also I believe pulseaudio did not show up on component-mismatches because the binaries were still in main on armhf&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;slyon&gt; sarnold: I agree that having a higher level overview would be good.&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: but not so much in re-writing the same to have redundancy and mismatches.

I wondered what the wiki said at the time he wrote the endorsement and it doesn't look like he edited the wiki himself?&lt;br/&gt;[16:13] &lt;rbasak&gt; It's probably fine but he should probably confirm what it is he endorsed you for exactly.&lt;br/&gt;[16:15] &lt;rbasak&gt; I pinged him privately&lt;br/&gt;[16:16] &lt;rbasak&gt; Shall we ask questions in the meantime? I have a few unless someone else wants to drive first?&lt;br/&gt;[16:16] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; he is around&lt;br/&gt;[16:16] &lt;bryceh&gt; hi, sorry, was in another meeting.&lt;br/&gt;[16:16] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but he'd had to let me down for you :-P&lt;br/&gt;[16:17] &lt;rbasak&gt; bryceh: thanks for joining! Your endorsement at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/mitchdz/ServerUploaderDeveloperApplication#Bryce_Harrington - is that for PPU or the server packageset please?&lt;br/&gt;[16:17] &lt;rbasak&gt; Meanwhile I guess I'll start with questions&lt;br/&gt;[16:17] &lt;bryceh&gt; server packageset was what I had in mind, was he applying for PPU?&lt;br/&gt;[16:18] &lt;rbasak&gt; That's fine - your endorsement says PPU&lt;br/&gt;[16:18] &lt;bryceh&gt; ah, sorry, then I was wrong&lt;br/&gt;[16:18] &lt;rbasak&gt; No worries. The wiki history didn't leave me any wiser. Thank you for confirming!&lt;br/&gt;[16:19] &lt;rbasak&gt; mitchdz: OK so first question. At what point in the release cycle must you stop uploading feature changes, where can you find that information, how do you decide what constitutes a feature change, what do you do if you want an exception?&lt;br/&gt;[16:19] &lt;mitchdz&gt; Thanks bryce!&lt;br/&gt;[16:21] &lt;mitchdz&gt; Thanks Robie, For oracular, as an example, you can find those dates at https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/oracular-oriole-release-schedule/36460 where August 15th is Feature Freeze. Feature freeze is any changes that adds a feature which is pretty much most things that are not strictly bug fixes or cosmetic changes such as branding.&lt;br/&gt;[16:22] &lt;mitchdz&gt; You will file an FFE to make any feature changes&lt;br/&gt;[16:22] &lt;rbasak&gt; Great. Where's the process for filing an FFe documented please?&lt;br/&gt;[16:22] &lt;mitchdz&gt; https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FreezeExceptionProcess&lt;br/&gt;[16:23] &lt;rbasak&gt; Excellent. Next, let's say that you upload an Ubuntu delta to a server package. What happens next wrt. that delta? What the process to ensure that we continue to keep up with changes upstream?&lt;br/&gt;[16:25] &lt;mitchdz&gt; First I like to see if the change is relevant for upstream, and if not, then I look to include the changes in Debian so we do not diverge. If it does not apply to either (for example, it's a change for systemd and Debian wants sysvinit) I'll make a delta with sufficient comments explaining why we are holding those changes, and what to look out for when doing the next merge or fixing bugs.&lt;br/&gt;[16:25] &lt;rbasak&gt; when doing the next merge&gt; how do you ensure that this happens and doesn't get forgotten about?&lt;br/&gt;[16:27] &lt;mitchdz&gt; There's a few ways, 2 that I like - first I like to have a descriptive summary in the git commit message stating to carry it over, look into it more, or potentially drop. Second option if it might require a discussion is to bring it up on the merge bug in LP.&lt;br/&gt;[16:27] &lt;rbasak&gt; Where does the LP merge bug come from?&lt;br/&gt;[16:28] &lt;mitchdz&gt; For the server packages Bryce usually makes them&lt;br/&gt;[16:28] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK :)&lt;br/&gt;[16:28] &lt;rbasak&gt; I suppose what I was looking for is that you understand that the process is that the server team tracks these things :)&lt;br/&gt;[16:28] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; I'd also like to add information in patches, if they are, as PEP-3 guidelines :)&lt;br/&gt;[16:29] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; DEP* :)&lt;br/&gt;[16:29] &lt;rbasak&gt; Next, let's say you do an upload to add a delta. What do you need to ensure next, and how do you do that?&lt;br/&gt;[16:29] &lt;mitchdz&gt; Definitely Utkarsh, those help too :)&lt;br/&gt;[16:30] &lt;mitchdz&gt; rbasak: Is this a general question of what should be done after a package is uploaded?&lt;br/&gt;[16:31] &lt;rbasak&gt; mitchdz: socially, you have some responsibilities in the days after you upload a package. What are those?&lt;br/&gt;[16:32] &lt;mitchdz&gt; Ah understood&lt;br/&gt;[16:33] &lt;mitchdz&gt; The package would then enter the unapproved queue and if it gets neglected, it would be nice to ping in IRC so it doesn't get lost. If the packages have any issues, it would be nice to guide along the issues especially if the committer is new to the process. Once the package is in the -proposed pocket then monitoring the package for any regressions is also necessary.&lt;br/&gt;[16:34] &lt;mitchdz&gt; s/commiter/individual making the changes/g&lt;br/&gt;[16:34] &lt;bdmurray&gt; What kind of "issues" could occru?&lt;br/&gt;[16:35] &lt;bdmurray&gt; s/occru/occur/&lt;br/&gt;[16:35] &lt;mitchdz&gt; Perhaps something wasn't caught such as a change that seems harmless, but upon further review could have side effects that are not intended&lt;br/&gt;[16:36] &lt;rbasak&gt; Are you thinking of an SRU specifically? I was thinking about an upload to the development release.&lt;br/&gt;[16:36] &lt;mitchdz&gt; Ah yes I'm in the SRU mindset mostly&lt;br/&gt;[16:36] &lt;mitchdz&gt; but a decent chunk of the process still applies to devel&lt;br/&gt;[16:36] &lt;rbasak&gt; I think your answer makes sense when speaking of an SRU, but please could you also answer the question for a development release upload?&lt;br/&gt;[16:37] &lt;mitchdz&gt; For development release it's common to add a lot of changes/features so it would be good to keep an eye out for new bugs coming out that pertain to changes you made, especially because you will probably be most informed about the changes so could address them easily.&lt;br/&gt;[16:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK, so let's say that you do that upload and the package is built in oracular-proposed. What happens next?&lt;br/&gt;[16:38] &lt;bdmurray&gt; How would you learn about regressions for a package version in -proposed?&lt;br/&gt;[16:38] &lt;mitchdz&gt; You would look for your package in https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses.html&lt;br/&gt;[16:39] &lt;mitchdz&gt; I usually just ctrl+f the package name I'm working on to see if anything is sad now&lt;br/&gt;[16:40] &lt;rbasak&gt; Do you know where the documentation is with guides for working on that page?&lt;br/&gt;[16:40] &lt;mitchdz&gt; Would that be this page? https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-maintainers-handbook/blob/main/ProposedMigration.md&lt;br/&gt;[16:41] &lt;rbasak&gt; Sure, that'll do :)&lt;br/&gt;[16:41] &lt;rbasak&gt; Thanks! I have no more questions.&lt;br/&gt;[16:41] &lt;mitchdz&gt; Thanks Robie :)&lt;br/&gt;[16:44] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; ok, no questions from me either.&lt;br/&gt;[16:44] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I have no further questions.&lt;br/&gt;[16:44] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; sil2100?&lt;br/&gt;[16:44] &lt;sil2100&gt; No question&lt;br/&gt;[16:45] &lt;sil2100&gt; ...s&lt;br/&gt;[16:45] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; coolio, I'll proceed to vote then&lt;br/&gt;[16:45] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; #vote Mitchell Dzurick to get PPU rights for Server related packages&lt;br/&gt;[16:45] &lt;meetingology&gt; Please vote on: Mitchell Dzurick to get PPU rights for Server related packages&lt;br/&gt;[16:45] &lt;meetingology&gt; Public votes can be registered by saying +1, -1 or +0 in channel (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1|-1|+0 #channelname')&lt;br/&gt;[16:45] &lt;rbasak&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[16:45] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 received from rbasak&lt;br/&gt;[16:46] &lt;bdmurray&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[16:46] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 received from bdmurray&lt;br/&gt;[16:46] &lt;sil2100&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[16:46] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 received from sil2100&lt;br/&gt;[16:46] &lt;rbasak&gt; FWIW, it's not PPU.

It mainly sets up SWAP on the system and talks to the AWS backend to get information.&lt;br/&gt;[16:51] &lt;mitchdz&gt; It's one of those packages that often needs a change "all the way back" usually to Focal for pretty simple changes&lt;br/&gt;[16:52] &lt;mitchdz&gt; So I would like to get uploader rights to help alleviate the burden of finding a sponsor for these types of packages&lt;br/&gt;[16:52] &lt;rbasak&gt; So the first couple of sponsored uploads I looked into seem to have significant review feedback.&lt;br/&gt;[16:52] &lt;rbasak&gt; https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ec2-hibinit-agent/+bug/2031345/comments/4 is one&lt;br/&gt;[16:52] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2031345 in ec2-hibinit-agent (Ubuntu Lunar) "Swap file remains unnecessarily large if system memory size decreases" [Undecided, Fix Released]&lt;br/&gt;[16:53] &lt;mitchdz&gt; Heh yeah, those were some of my first changes so I was learning a bit back then :)&lt;br/&gt;[16:53] &lt;rbasak&gt; https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ec2-hibinit-agent/+bug/2023924/comments/10 is another&lt;br/&gt;[16:53] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2023924 in ec2-hibinit-agent (Ubuntu Mantic) "The latest version creates /\'/var/lib/hibinit-agent\' directory" [Undecided, Fix Released]&lt;br/&gt;[16:54] &lt;rbasak&gt; That may be so but those are (nearly) your most recent ec2-hibinit-agent uploads&lt;br/&gt;[16:56] &lt;rbasak&gt; It feels like this is a tricky, messy package (by its nature - not a problem with the packaging itself)&lt;br/&gt;[16:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; IMHO, it needs careful review, and the still fairly recent track record seems to suggest that this is a good thing and should continue for now, IMHO.&lt;br/&gt;[16:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; It's subjective though and others' views may vary!&lt;br/&gt;[16:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; I don't think it's anything you've done or not done, but my conclusion for now is that it's inappropriate for a new uploader to have PPU for this.&lt;br/&gt;[16:58] &lt;mitchdz&gt; That's fair enough, I can definitely come again when more changes are done. I get requests for a lot of changes and have pushed back on a few since they don't apply to Ubuntu&lt;br/&gt;[16:59] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; just to be clear - mitchdz, you'll apply again in the upcoming weeks and not now, right?&lt;br/&gt;[16:59] &lt;rbasak&gt; What I'd like to see is a track record of sponsored uploads where you've successfully anticipated key points of review feedback. It's fine if you've antipicated by asking questions though!&lt;br/&gt;[17:00] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'd want those examples to be of similar complexity to the previous uploads.&lt;br/&gt;[17:01] &lt;mitchdz&gt; Yeah if we decide not to do the PPU for ec2-hibinit-agent, that will be a later date&lt;br/&gt;[17:01] &lt;mitchdz&gt; or perhaps I'll work towards the new ubuntu-cloud :)&lt;br/&gt;[17:01] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; got it, alright, thanks&lt;br/&gt;[17:01] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; we're already at the top of the hour&lt;br/&gt;[17:01] &lt;bryceh&gt; or core-dev...?  ;=)&lt;br/&gt;[17:02] &lt;rbasak&gt; I remain concerned that sgmoore's ML request still has not had an answer.&lt;br/&gt;[17:02] &lt;rbasak&gt; Can someone take that please?&lt;br/&gt;[17:02] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; yes, I plan to do it this week&lt;br/&gt;[17:02] &lt;rbasak&gt; We can't keep skipping the standing agenda items :-(&lt;br/&gt;[17:02] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; I have a rough draft ready, just need to polish it, and send it out&lt;br/&gt;[17:02] &lt;rbasak&gt; Thanks!

The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards&lt;br/&gt;[12:15] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.&lt;br/&gt;[12:15] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).&lt;br/&gt;[12:15] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.&lt;br/&gt;[12:15] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.&lt;br/&gt;[12:15] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)&lt;br/&gt;[12:15] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...&lt;br/&gt;[12:16] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; First up, we have Soumyadeep Ghosh (soumyadghosh).

Can I unload a specific profile, without having its "source" on disk?

But for a summary, I have been an Ubuntu user for a long time but started contributing since last year (from Ubuntu Summit). I am not part of any Canonical team, just a community volunteer and like to look at bugs in my spare time.&lt;br/&gt;[19:04] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; And you're also a DD since 2020. Nice.&lt;br/&gt;[19:04] &lt;sudip&gt; yes :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:04] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; \o/&lt;br/&gt;[19:05] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; thanks, sudip&lt;br/&gt;[19:05] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; with that, I am going to open the floor for questions&lt;br/&gt;[19:05] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; *ta dum*&lt;br/&gt;[19:05] &lt;rbasak&gt; Disclosure: sudip is local to me, I see him regularly, and I introduced him to various Ubuntu-specific bits at the Ubuntu Summit in Riga last year. I don't think that there's sufficient conflict of interest to recuse myself though (or else we'd never get anywhere with promising applicants that we get to know well!)&lt;br/&gt;[19:06] &lt;rbasak&gt; ...and thanks to utkarsh2102 for introducing us :-)&lt;br/&gt;[19:06] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; hehe&lt;br/&gt;[19:06] &lt;sudip&gt; yes, thanks to utkarsh2102&lt;br/&gt;[19:06] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; which means, I know Sudip as well. :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:06] &lt;sudip&gt; lol, yes, you do&lt;br/&gt;[19:07] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; but there's no conflict of interest, I haven't directly worked with Sudip but have interacted a bunch - he's a &lt;3 person.&lt;br/&gt;[19:07] &lt;rbasak&gt; So let me start with a question on transitions. sudip: how would you identify if you're about to trigger a transition when you're ready to upload?&lt;br/&gt;[19:08] &lt;sudip&gt; I will first check Debian bug report if there was transition request or not. If there is one, then it will definitely trigger a transition in Ubuntu. But if its not a Debian package and it bumps soname or changes API/ABI then I will check rdep.&lt;br/&gt;[19:09] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK. In the common case, how would you identify if the upload bumps soname?&lt;br/&gt;[19:09]  * sil2100 has a question when there's a moment&lt;br/&gt;[19:09]  * utkarsh2102 joins the queue&lt;br/&gt;[19:09] &lt;sudip&gt; the package version should change, like libfoo0 will become libfoo1&lt;br/&gt;[19:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; Thanks! I have further questions but let's go to sil2100 first I guess?&lt;br/&gt;[19:10] &lt;sil2100&gt; o/&lt;br/&gt;[19:10] &lt;sudip&gt; but again, there was a recent Debian bug where the package version was not changed with SONAME bump&lt;br/&gt;[19:11] &lt;sil2100&gt; sudip: let's say you want to bring a completely new piece of software into Ubuntu. How would you do that? What are the possible options and processes for that?&lt;br/&gt;[19:12] &lt;sudip&gt; I will prefer to do it in Debian first. But if I have to do it in Ubuntu, then iirc, it needs to be reviewed by two core-dev first&lt;br/&gt;[19:13] &lt;sil2100&gt; sudip: can you elaborate on the two core-devs?&lt;br/&gt;[19:14] &lt;sudip&gt; well, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/NewPackages says "MOTUs can upload new packages directly to the archive. However they are greatly encouraged to have a new package reviewed prior to uploading"&lt;br/&gt;[19:15] &lt;sudip&gt; and I was wrong about 2 core-dev, that is an old requirement which has been dropped now&lt;br/&gt;[19:15] &lt;sil2100&gt; Is uploading the package the only thing that's needed? And when will the package be made available in Ubuntu?&lt;br/&gt;[19:17] &lt;sudip&gt; new packages will go through a review process and final review by the archieve admins&lt;br/&gt;[19:17] &lt;sil2100&gt; Where will the review progress be tracked? Is there any 'paperwork' related to requesting new packages to Ubuntu?&lt;br/&gt;[19:18] &lt;sudip&gt; there needs to be a bug open for that for packaging it&lt;br/&gt;[19:19] &lt;sil2100&gt; Fair enough! Ok, thank you :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:19] &lt;sudip&gt; I missed saying with the tag "needs-packaging."&lt;br/&gt;[19:19] &lt;sil2100&gt; I open the floor to others&lt;br/&gt;[19:22]  * sudip waits for questions from utkarsh2102 and rbasak &lt;br/&gt;[19:22] &lt;rbasak&gt; sudip: where can you find the dates of the relevant freezes in the current Ubuntu development cycle? For feature freeze in particular, what would you need to consider if for example feature freeze were active for Oracular and you were looking at uploading version 2.3.2 of package foo while 2.3.1 were in the Oracular release pocket?&lt;br/&gt;[19:23] &lt;sudip&gt; Oracular FF is at https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/oracular-oriole-release-schedule/36460&lt;br/&gt;[19:24] &lt;sudip&gt; depends on 2.3.2 diff&lt;br/&gt;[19:24] &lt;sudip&gt; if its a leaf package then I will be comfortable with it&lt;br/&gt;[19:25] &lt;sudip&gt; but if its a library, then I will check the diff to confirm there is no ABI/API change&lt;br/&gt;[19:25] &lt;rbasak&gt; Could you give me an example of a change that, if it were in the diff, should block it from being uploaded during feature freeze without an exception?&lt;br/&gt;[19:25] &lt;rbasak&gt; Oh I suppose you already answered that, sorry :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:25] &lt;sudip&gt; :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:25] &lt;rbasak&gt; What's the process of getting an exception if you thought one were appropriate?&lt;br/&gt;[19:26] &lt;sudip&gt; I need to file a bug and attach the debdiff to it and subscribe the release team&lt;br/&gt;[19:27] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK, thanks! Moving on, after you've uploaded a delta to Ubuntu, what happens next?&lt;br/&gt;[19:27] &lt;sudip&gt; when a package is uploaded it will first go to -proposed where it will be built for all the arch its supposed to go to, autopkgtests will be run, if there are autopkgtest of the rdeps then those will also be run. And, if tests are ok, then it will migrate to the release suite.&lt;br/&gt;[19:28] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK. And if something holds up migration, then who needs to take care of that and where can they find more information about it?&lt;br/&gt;[19:29] &lt;sudip&gt; update_excuses will have the details and usually its the responsibility of the uploader to check and take care of that&lt;br/&gt;[19:29] &lt;rbasak&gt; Thanks. Long term, what happens to the Ubuntu delta with respect to further packaging/upstream updates in Debian?&lt;br/&gt;[19:30] &lt;sudip&gt; Usually I also open a Debian bug if the bug is reproduced in  unstable, and the delta is added to Debian then it needs a sync or else with the new Debian package we have to do a merge&lt;br/&gt;[19:31] &lt;rbasak&gt; Do you know how to find packages that require a merge?&lt;br/&gt;[19:31] &lt;sudip&gt; I check at https://merges.ubuntu.com/&lt;br/&gt;[19:31] &lt;sudip&gt; mostly - https://merges.ubuntu.com/universe.html?showProposed=true&amp;showMergeNeeded=true&amp;showLongBinaries=true&lt;br/&gt;[19:31] &lt;rbasak&gt; Great.

The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards&lt;br/&gt;[22:17] &lt;mapreri&gt; Today we only have one applicant, whom is here already, and we also have a quorum, so I see no reason as to why we shouldn't be able to handle it today!&lt;br/&gt;[22:17] &lt;mapreri&gt; Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.&lt;br/&gt;[22:17] &lt;mapreri&gt; During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.&lt;br/&gt;[22:17] &lt;mapreri&gt; When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)&lt;br/&gt;[22:17] &lt;mapreri&gt; Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...&lt;br/&gt;[22:17] &lt;mapreri&gt; #topic Bright Adams &lt; Mrbite &gt;&lt;br/&gt;[22:18] &lt;mapreri&gt; Mrbite: please introduce yourself and share your links to IRC as well.&lt;br/&gt;[22:20] &lt;mapreri&gt; Mrbite: ?&lt;br/&gt;[22:22] &lt;Mrbite&gt; My name is Bright Adams.

some older ones that are stuck&lt;br/&gt;[14:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we might mark them as that .. hmm&lt;br/&gt;[14:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we need wording for https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues/51&lt;br/&gt;[14:46] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Issue 51 in canonical/ubuntu-mir "cargo vendor adds unnecessary crates" [Open]&lt;br/&gt;[14:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm: do you think you could provide a PR that wraps the consensus mentioned by slyon into words&lt;br/&gt;[14:46] &lt;eslerm&gt; I can&lt;br/&gt;[14:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks in advance&lt;br/&gt;[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues/55&lt;br/&gt;[14:47] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Issue 55 in canonical/ubuntu-mir "end-of-cycle unexpected changes" [Open]&lt;br/&gt;[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; has tackled the obvious things&lt;br/&gt;[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the rest is "looking for volunteers" to tackle more&lt;br/&gt;[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; speak up if anyone wants to ... :-)&lt;br/&gt;[14:48] &lt;eslerm&gt; possibly, we could add that an owning teams director needs to request late MIRs&lt;br/&gt;[14:48] &lt;eslerm&gt; we had a last second libyuv request, which ended up not beeing needed after ack'd&lt;br/&gt;[14:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; there's a few cases to care for -- one with the "the team didn't plan" and then the "oh upstream or debian has walked away from package foo because they're switching to package bar"&lt;br/&gt;[14:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; i think our "you get to talk to the director of security engineering" is a decent speedbump to discourage the first one, but I wish we could come up with some clever ideas to spot the overlooked packages&lt;br/&gt;[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm happy with adding "bring high level for late requests"&lt;br/&gt;[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; bring wording in a PR for that for discussion please&lt;br/&gt;[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; for the other case let us brainstorm for 3 minutes ...&lt;br/&gt;[14:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; It plays into the "re-evaluate things in main" TBH&lt;br/&gt;[14:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; which we asked for but got denied for resourcing&lt;br/&gt;[14:51] &lt;eslerm&gt; that's not what I mean with #22&lt;br/&gt;[14:51] &lt;sarnold&gt; storm idea one, look for new Replaces: or maybe dropped Depends: from other packages?&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;eslerm&gt; it is for cases where there is ack for the MIR, but then owning team goes idle for a long period of time (say 2 years)&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;eslerm&gt; I am okay dropping issue though&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;sarnold&gt; storm idea two, look for new packages with small levenstein distances from packages already in main&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: I think we usually get signal by bugs, the cases I see crashing as where responsibility and ownership is unclear.&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: which does not mean I'd not like a scanner that provides extra signal&lt;br/&gt;[14:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm: now I got you - like "what is the consequence if they make us busy and then walk away" ?&lt;br/&gt;[14:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm: I'm not sure, but things change - so that can not always be prevented IMHO.&lt;br/&gt;[14:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm: not sure if defining negative consequences would help, or did you have something completely different in mind?&lt;br/&gt;[14:54] &lt;eslerm&gt; mostly, this occured and then a package was added to main, and I believe it should have had a quick re-review first&lt;br/&gt;[14:54] &lt;eslerm&gt; it's not about negative consequences for us doing the work, just that more work is needed if a review has gone "stale"&lt;br/&gt;[14:55] &lt;slyon&gt; so adding something like a timeout on an ACK?&lt;br/&gt;[14:55] &lt;eslerm&gt; yes, I proposed 2 years&lt;br/&gt;[14:56] &lt;slyon&gt; sounds reasonable to me.&lt;br/&gt;[14:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm +1 on timeout on an Ack&lt;br/&gt;[14:56] &lt;slyon&gt; cpaelzer: that would be like our re-review idea, but only for things that didn't make it into "main" yet.&lt;br/&gt;[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; While we do not get a re-review, if it didn't make it into main it is fine to time out&lt;br/&gt;[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: exactly&lt;br/&gt;[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; anyone willing to provide a wording PR for that?&lt;br/&gt;[14:57] &lt;eslerm&gt; I can propose a PR&lt;br/&gt;[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thank you&lt;br/&gt;[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; uh, time flies&lt;br/&gt;[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; let us go on ...&lt;br/&gt;[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt;

An attacker needs to make an unauthenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability. &lt;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-49606&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[00:16] &lt;Unit193&gt; (https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tinyproxy/1.11.1-4)&lt;br/&gt;=== chris14_ is now known as chris14&lt;br/&gt;[05:26] &lt;sudhackar&gt; hey mcphail: did you get a reply to your ask earlier?&lt;br/&gt;[05:46] &lt;mcphail&gt; sudhackar: no&lt;br/&gt;[06:42] &lt;ebarretto&gt; amurray, fyi ^ &lt;br/&gt;[07:40] &lt;amurray&gt; mcphail: apologies for the delay on this - I am just now trying to get confirmation from the associated dev team - will let you know ASAP but I hope it shouldn't be more than 1 or 2 weeks at most&lt;br/&gt;[08:16] &lt;mcphail&gt; Cheers amurray :)&lt;br/&gt;=== crazybyte25 is now known as crazybyte2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;# UBUNTU-MEETING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">10.05.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</guid><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>09.05.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</title><description># UBUNTU-SECURITY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=== chris14_ is now known as chris14&lt;br/&gt;[15:40] &lt;mcphail&gt; Hi.

Why aren't desktop-related packages that you need to upload as part of desktop work already the ubuntu-desktop packageset?&lt;br/&gt;[16:08] &lt;rbasak&gt; (maybe not really a question for you)&lt;br/&gt;[16:08] &lt;rbasak&gt; I ask because if we fixed that, surely that would help more people than just you?&lt;br/&gt;[16:09] &lt;rbasak&gt; Perhaps there are some packages that shouldn't belong in ubuntu-desktop for which you getting core dev privileges would help, but I'm unclear on what those are.&lt;br/&gt;[16:09] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; also, I note that there are endorsements from people who are not Ubuntu members/MOTU/core dev. Can they still endorse? I'd expect them to be in the "Comments" section.&lt;br/&gt;[16:09] &lt;bandali&gt; right, that's a great question but unfortunately i don't have the historical background (i wish Seb was here today). but i know it goes back at least 4 years, and most likely many more years before that&lt;br/&gt;[16:09] &lt;teward&gt; i have a followup on that, why do you need coredev if instead you could apply for the specific packagesets&lt;br/&gt;[16:09] &lt;teward&gt; (even if we didnt consolidate all the desktop pkgsets today)&lt;br/&gt;[16:09] &lt;rbasak&gt; Could you perhaps elaborate on exactly which packages you would like to upload, and which of those packages you have had sponsored, that do not belong in the ubuntu-desktop packageset?&lt;br/&gt;[16:09] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; if so, then only two core-devs which are both in ~Desktop. Are there people who you've worked outside ~Desktop?&lt;br/&gt;[16:10] &lt;bandali&gt; i'm applying for core-dev in part because i don't *only* work on desktop packages&lt;br/&gt;[16:11] &lt;rbasak&gt; i don't *only* work on desktop packages&gt; OK - could you elaborate then please on exactly which packages we're talking about?&lt;br/&gt;[16:12] &lt;bandali&gt; being a DD, i work on packages across the Debian archives (e.g. i maintain jami, opendht, restinio, etc.)&lt;br/&gt;[16:12] &lt;bandali&gt; i believe there a number of exampels of non-desktop packages i've worked on on my application page, if you search for 'non-desktop'&lt;br/&gt;[16:12] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK but I don't see any sponsored uploads of those packages into Ubuntu.&lt;br/&gt;[16:13] &lt;teward&gt; ^^ that&lt;br/&gt;[16:13] &lt;bandali&gt; how about poppler?&lt;br/&gt;[16:13] &lt;rbasak&gt; We should certainly consider PPU for the packages that you maintain in Debian&lt;br/&gt;[16:14] &lt;bandali&gt; i also do +1 rotations every now and again, and being able to upload those directly would be great&lt;br/&gt;[16:15] &lt;rbasak&gt; For a core dev application, I'd like to start by seeing your track record of sponsorship in Ubuntu for the packages that you are looking to upload. To be clear, I'm not saying that there's a hard requirement to have these, but I'd like to understand where you are and that's usually my starting point, and I'm struggling to identify the subset of your sponsored uploads that relate to this application.&lt;br/&gt;[16:15] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; I was wondering if a path like packageset -&gt; MOTU -&gt; core-dev would be good. So essentially, MOTU being the next target?&lt;br/&gt;[16:15] &lt;bandali&gt; it so happens that for my last +1 shift i was able to do all of my work directly in Debian, but being able to do that work directly in Ubuntu would be nice&lt;br/&gt;[16:15] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; re: +1 work^&lt;br/&gt;[16:16] &lt;bandali&gt; i did initially consider MOTU first, but thought it might be good to skip directly to core-dev since i've worked on a number of non-desktop main packages like poppler etc. that aren't in universe and so not addressed by motu&lt;br/&gt;[16:17] &lt;bandali&gt; and thought that my background and experience as a DD would have provided me with the skills to aim directly for core-dev&lt;br/&gt;[16:17] &lt;rbasak&gt; I realise that poppler isn't strictly desktop since I suppose it can be used usefully in a server environment, but it does still feel desktop-y. Has it been considered for the ubuntu-desktop packageset?&lt;br/&gt;[16:18] &lt;bandali&gt; not that i know of, i'd defer to Seb to clarify that&lt;br/&gt;[16:19] &lt;bandali&gt; (also, to be clear, this is the part of the page i was referring to earlier: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/bandali/core-dev-application#non-desktop )&lt;br/&gt;[16:20] &lt;rbasak&gt; Did you take that from the sponsorship miner / udd? I'm looking the miner results at https://udd.debian.org/cgi-bin/ubuntu-sponsorships.cgi?render=html&amp;sponsor=&amp;sponsor_search=name&amp;sponsoree=*bandali*&amp;sponsoree_search=name and it seems a bit messed up :-(&lt;br/&gt;[16:21] &lt;bandali&gt; err yes i think so&lt;br/&gt;[16:21] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; I was gonna get to that, too :)&lt;br/&gt;[16:21] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; there seems to be a mismatch&lt;br/&gt;[16:21] &lt;bandali&gt; yeah e.g. some of that aren't SRUs&lt;br/&gt;[16:21] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; a lot of those uploads are uploads to Debian&lt;br/&gt;[16:21] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; and a sync here&lt;br/&gt;[16:22] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; that's why some won't show up in UDD&lt;br/&gt;[16:22] &lt;bandali&gt; sorry i probably should've cleaned that up beforehand. in my defence i wasn't sure if there would be a meeting today..&lt;br/&gt;[16:23] &lt;teward&gt; bandali: it's always best to **assume there will be a meeting** if you've placed yourself in the agenda&lt;br/&gt;[16:23] &lt;teward&gt; because otherwise you arrive here unprepared&lt;br/&gt;[16:23] &lt;bandali&gt; teward, that's what i assumed the last times it didn't happen :)&lt;br/&gt;[16:23] &lt;bandali&gt; but ack&lt;br/&gt;[16:25] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; bandali: I see almost all uploads by Jeremy and some by Seb. Whilst that's not a problem, I am wondering if you have worked with core-devs outside ~Desktop?&lt;br/&gt;[16:25] &lt;rbasak&gt; Do you have any SRU experience for regular bugfixes?&lt;br/&gt;[16:25] &lt;rbasak&gt; I only see https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gtk4/4.12.3+ds-1ubuntu0.1 which looks like an upstream point release. Are there any other SRUs you've had sponsored?&lt;br/&gt;[16:26] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, yes indeed, just about all my uploads to Ubuntu have been sponsored by Jeremy and Seb&lt;br/&gt;[16:26] &lt;bandali&gt; rbasak, i believe i had several more. lemme see if i can find them quickly&lt;br/&gt;[16:28] &lt;sil2100&gt; bandali: related to rbasak's question: what do you need to consider when preparing for an SRU upload? What can be uploaded as an SRU, what is the process and how to make it land in a stable series?&lt;br/&gt;[16:28] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; and on that note, I had a question.What if a package X is on version 1.2.3-1 in Focal and 1.2.4-1 in Mantic, Jammy, Noble, and devel (Oracular now). And there's a bug you'd like to fix for X at least for Focal, what will be the next steps?&lt;br/&gt;[16:28] &lt;bandali&gt; rbasak, e.g. there's this nautilus one https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/1:42.6-0ubuntu1 but as a component of GNOME core, it has a micro-release exception&lt;br/&gt;[16:29] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm really looking for "regular" ones please&lt;br/&gt;[16:30] &lt;rbasak&gt; (since they exercise the SRU process much more compleely - do you have experience of doing that?)&lt;br/&gt;[16:30] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; I have more questions, but I'll let you get the above ones squared away first :)&lt;br/&gt;[16:30] &lt;bandali&gt; rbasak, i recall doing some but i'm afraid i don't have a link handy at this moment. i'll let you know if i can find though&lt;br/&gt;[16:30] &lt;bandali&gt; sil2100, typing my answer to your question now&lt;br/&gt;[16:30] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; :(&lt;br/&gt;[16:30] &lt;sil2100&gt; Thank you! :)&lt;br/&gt;[16:32] &lt;bandali&gt; sil2100, generally speaking, SRUs should only contain bug fixes and no new features. the procedure is described on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates, including a sample template for the accompanying bug that needs to be filed on LP to explain the rationale for the SRU, its potential impact on users, and the bug(s) it aims to fix and how that can be validated (that it indeed fixes though&lt;br/&gt;[16:32] &lt;bandali&gt; bugs)&lt;br/&gt;[16:32] &lt;bandali&gt; (also including a test plan for testing and validation of the fix, of course)&lt;br/&gt;[16:33] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, typing an answer to your question now&lt;br/&gt;[16:35] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, generally the fix should also be prepared for all affected later Ubuntu releases as well, so that upgrading to newer releases wouldn't cause a regression again&lt;br/&gt;[16:35] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; bandali: okay, thanks, what versions would you use for each releases, then?&lt;br/&gt;[16:37] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, the versions of X would have to be crafted in a way to ensure that they are in increasing order from one Ubuntu release to the next, so that apt would correctly pick it up as an upgrade&lt;br/&gt;[16:37] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; yes, can you give me exact versions please?&lt;br/&gt;[16:37] &lt;sil2100&gt; bandali: thanks. And once the SRU gets accepted into -proposed, what does the uploader need to do? What are their responsibilities? When will the update be made avilable to the users?&lt;br/&gt;[16:38] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, e.g. 1.2.3-1ubuntu1 in focal, perhaps 1.2.3-2ubuntu1 in jammy, and 1.2.4-1ubuntu in mantic&lt;br/&gt;[16:40] &lt;bandali&gt; sil2100, the uploader would then do validation on the -proposed upload to verify that the indeed fixes all the bugs it claims to have fixed and introduced no regressions. then mark the bug as verification-done-$rel&lt;br/&gt;[16:41] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; I am afraid that's not quite correct :(&lt;br/&gt;[16:41] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; bandali: see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdatePreparation :)&lt;br/&gt;[16:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; bandali: the uploader would then do validation&gt; specifically, what would be considered an acceptable level of validation, and what would not? At that stage in the process, how could the uploader be sure that the validation they're performing will be considered acceptable by the SRU team?&lt;br/&gt;[16:42] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, ack&lt;br/&gt;[16:42] &lt;bandali&gt; sil2100, once verified, the upload would then be released to users via -updates, potentially with phasing and monitoring that e.g. there are indeed no increased crash rates&lt;br/&gt;[16:44] &lt;bandali&gt; rbasak, the details would vary from one case to the next, but i believe at minimum the uploader would need to exercise the agreed upon test plan for the package being updated&lt;br/&gt;[16:45] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK. And if, after an SRU you prepared is released, you discover that it resulted in a serious regression, what should you do?&lt;br/&gt;[16:45] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; re: +1 maint: once you've uploaded a package to the devel release, is there something else you should be doing?&lt;br/&gt;[16:47] &lt;bandali&gt; rbasak, if it's still in phasing, the phasing should be halted and a new SRU with the fix prepared. if it's ineed a serious/critical regression, one would need to prepare a new stop-gap upload effectively rolling the package back to previous version, while another upload could be prepared&lt;br/&gt;[16:48] &lt;rbasak&gt; bandali: OK, but what's the process to arrange these things?&lt;br/&gt;[16:49] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, generally, i'd check if the devel upload contains fixes potentially relevant to existing stable releases and if so, prepare an SRU.  i'd also check if my fix for Ubuntu could be applied upstream in Debian, or perhaps even better, directly to the main upstream project, and forward my patch(es) to them accordingly. if that's not quite the answer you were looking for, would you please&lt;br/&gt;[16:49] &lt;bandali&gt; clarify?&lt;br/&gt;[16:51] &lt;bandali&gt; rbasak, as in, e.g. what version to use for an upload of the previous working version?&lt;br/&gt;[16:53] &lt;rbasak&gt; bandali: sorry no that's not what I'm asking. Imagine you've just heard about this serious regression and Jeremy and Seb are unavailable. As a core dev, your team is looking to you to sort things out. What's the established process to alert the SRU team?&lt;br/&gt;[16:54] &lt;rbasak&gt; You may understand that the SRU team will stop phasing and/or urgently review your revert upload, but how is it that you will get their attention to do this?&lt;br/&gt;[16:55] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; bandali: my question is limited to the devel release you may upload to, once the upload is done, where does it go? what next steps you might want to work on to ensure the entire work's done?&lt;br/&gt;[16:56] &lt;bandali&gt; rbasak, for contacting the SRU team, i'd check https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates#Contacting_the_SRU_team to see who is on rotation that day, and ping them in #ubuntu-release or directly to draw their attention to the matter&lt;br/&gt;[16:57] &lt;teward&gt; fyi guys I have a hard-stop in 3 minutes&lt;br/&gt;[16:58] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; okay, I'll start to push this faster&lt;br/&gt;[16:58] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, oh, thanks for the clarification. normally, the upload to devel would land immediately. but that won't be the case e.g. during one of the devel freezes (where the package would land in -proposed) or if the package is NEW&lt;br/&gt;[16:58] &lt;bandali&gt; and would need to be manually reviewed and approved by an AA&lt;br/&gt;[16:58] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm not sure we can conclude today :-(&lt;br/&gt;[16:59] &lt;teward&gt; rbasak: i don't think we can either, but feel free to continue the meeting&lt;br/&gt;[16:59] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; bandali: if I am not mistaken, the upload to devel don't just land to the -release pocket immediately.&lt;br/&gt;[16:59] &lt;teward&gt; just poke me when you need a vote&lt;br/&gt;[16:59] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; it goes to -proposed and then to -release subsequently&lt;br/&gt;[16:59] &lt;teward&gt; (I won't be able to do much else here at that point though, I already have my info I need for a vote)&lt;br/&gt;[17:00] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, oh? i thought they only went through -proposed e.g. during freezes, but sorry if i got that wrong&lt;br/&gt;[17:00] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; do you know what's the process for an upload to move from -proposed to -release&lt;br/&gt;[17:00] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; teward: if you have your vote ready, can I proxy that if we conclude in a bit?&lt;br/&gt;[17:00] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; you could perhaps DM me and I can comment on your behald&lt;br/&gt;[17:00] &lt;teward&gt; utkarsh2102: i'll just leave it in paste so you can say "please vote" with a ping to me and i'll hit enter&lt;br/&gt;[17:01] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; teward: works perfectly for me&lt;br/&gt;[17:01] &lt;bandali&gt; not sure off top my head, i'm afraid. but i'd imagine a member of ubuntu-release would shepherd it through?&lt;br/&gt;[17:01] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; bandali: I am afraid not, it's the duty of the uploader to shepherd it&lt;br/&gt;[17:02] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; and only contact the release team when you've tried all the obvious things that are blocking the migration&lt;br/&gt;[17:02] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK I was somewhere between "more information would help me vote" and "I think we have some more adminstrative matters to resolve first". But I'm afraid your answers continue to give me concern and so I'm a hard -1 now, and I don't see any point in dragging this on further.&lt;br/&gt;[17:02] &lt;bandali&gt; ack&lt;br/&gt;[17:02] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; ok, are we ready to vote in that case?&lt;br/&gt;[17:02] &lt;rbasak&gt; I've been writing up more specifics to give you some guidance on what to work on here. I'll continue doing that. I'll be a few minutes.&lt;br/&gt;[17:03] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; bandali: see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ProposedMigration/.

Anyway, I think it'd be helpful to work with a core-dev for a bit and get clarity on these processes and I'd also recommend getting more sponsorships from people outside ~Desktop. I'd also recommend going via MOTU, et al. This helps in inspiring some&lt;br/&gt;[17:07] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; confidence.&lt;br/&gt;[17:07] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; #endvote&lt;br/&gt;[17:07] &lt;meetingology&gt; Voting ended on: Amin Bandali to get Ubuntu Core Dev rights&lt;br/&gt;[17:07] &lt;meetingology&gt; Votes for: 0, Votes against: 4, Abstentions: 0&lt;br/&gt;[17:07] &lt;meetingology&gt; Motion denied&lt;br/&gt;[17:08] &lt;bandali&gt; thanks all for your feedback and time&lt;br/&gt;[17:08] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; I am sorry that the vote didn't go in favor.

ML is the best way if you'd like to reach us.&lt;br/&gt;[17:10] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; I am also happy to help with some sponsorship provided my capacity! o/&lt;br/&gt;[17:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; Here's some specifc feedback:&lt;br/&gt;[17:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; 1) I'd like clarity on what exactly you're looking to unblock by getting core dev privileges, and then a clear track record of sponsorship for those specific things. Right now I'm very unclear on this and this hampers me from objectively considering your application. If you already have a suitable track record, there's no reason to wait - we can just see it as an admistrative matter to help us&lt;br/&gt;[17:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; better assess your existing application.&lt;br/&gt;[17:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; 2) SRU knowledge and experience: I'd like to see experience of "regular" SRUs but so far I haven't seen anything apart from a couple of microrelease updates which follow a slightly different process. If you already have a suitable track record, there's no reason to wait - we can just see it as an admistrative matter to help us better assess your existing application. However, some of your&lt;br/&gt;[17:10] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; #action Utkarsh to send out a follow-up mail on the ML&lt;br/&gt;[17:10] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: Utkarsh to send out a follow-up mail on the ML&lt;br/&gt;[17:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; SRU-relted answers missed the mark (eg. on versions and on flagging regressions). I feel that you should know these better - the answers are documented, or you improve your answers through experience.&lt;br/&gt;[17:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; 3) Proposed migration. "i thought they only went through -proposed e.g. during freezes, but sorry if i got that wrong". This is indeed wrong, and I think a hard requirement for any core dev to understand. I'm also confused on how you achieved doing +1 maintenance without this knowledge. This suggests to me that you're assuming incorrect things about Ubuntu from your knowledge of Debian without&lt;br/&gt;[17:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; appreciating the key points on how our development processes differ. Please continue learning this.&lt;br/&gt;[17:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; 4) That you worked on the poppler transition is good but looking at the actual uploads it's not clear to me if your contribution was driving the transition and that you understood the whole process, given your answer about proposed migration above. We didn't get to discussing this.&lt;br/&gt;[17:11] &lt;rbasak&gt; 5) The above list isn't exhaustive - we ran out of time to discuss further. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RobieBasak/DMB/CoreDev for my opinion and what I expect you to know.&lt;br/&gt;[17:11] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; that's phenomenal advice, Robie. Thanks! o/&lt;br/&gt;[17:11] &lt;bandali&gt; thank you indeed for your detailed reply/feedback Robie, appreciate it&lt;br/&gt;[17:11] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; since we're overtime, I'll stop here formally and end the meeting..&lt;br/&gt;[17:11] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; #endmeeting&lt;br/&gt;[17:11] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting ended at 17:11:43 UTC.  Minutes at https://ubottu.com/meetingology/logs/ubuntu-meeting/2024/ubuntu-meeting.2024-04-29-16.03.moin.txt&lt;br/&gt;[17:12] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; ok, it's 10:40 PMÂ  here and I should run and have some food. Bye. o/&lt;br/&gt;[17:12] &lt;rbasak&gt; Thanks. Please do reach out if anything is unclear, and/or if you'd like to go through my expectations before re-applying.

So basically I have a k8s pod that has a host mount to /etc/apparmor.d , and that pod is responsible for generating and enforcing profiles using "apparmor_parser" from within, and then it gets enforced on the host. But for some reason the profile seems to block pods that tries to access the K8s API.  &lt;br/&gt;[06:08] &lt;primalpimmy&gt; even though all network is allowed in the profile &lt;br/&gt;[06:08] &lt;primalpimmy&gt; type=AVC msg=audit(1713956546.682:24729): apparmor="DENIED" operation="create" profile="kubearmor-default" pid=41265 comm="kubearmor" family="inet" sock_type="stream" protocol=0 requested_mask="create" denied_mask="create"&lt;br/&gt;[06:10] &lt;primalpimmy&gt; to fix this, I again have to run "apparmor_parser" on the host instead of inside that pod, and now it works as it should.&lt;br/&gt;[07:02] &lt;mcphail&gt; https://ubuntu.com//blog/whats-new-in-security-for-ubuntu-24-04-lts - thanks for this post, amurray . Is the unprivileged namespace hardening the reason why I can't run docker in a nesting-enabled lxc or lxd container using the noble nightlies? Is there a way around that, if that's the case?&lt;br/&gt;[19:40] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: sarnold: because it came up on Ask Ubuntu (https://askubuntu.com/questions/1511606/pci-audit-openssh-authentication-bypass-vulnerability-cve-2023-51767), I'm poking regarding CVE-2023-51767.  Is only openssh-ssh1 affected?  Or are all openssh servers (and yes it's possible to enforce newer SSH versions if I remember right!) impacted?  The question came up because of PCI/DSS compliance.&lt;br/&gt;[19:40] -ubottu:#ubuntu-security- OpenSSH through 9.6, when common types of DRAM are used, might allow row hammer attacks (for authentication bypass) because the integer value of authenticated in mm_answer_authpassword does not resist flips of a single bit. NOTE: this is applicable to a certain threat model of attacker-victim co-location in which the attacker has user privileges. &lt;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-51767&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[19:59] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: could we also annotate the bug with https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3656 which states this: "This attack was not demonstrated against stock OpenSSH, but instead against a modified sshd that had extra synchronisation added to make the attack easier. AFAIK achieving the timing required to successfully exploit is close to impossible in the real world. See section 9 of their paper &lt;br/&gt;[19:59] &lt;teward&gt; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.02545.pdf They don't mention it, but any kind of ASLR would increase the difficulty of attack by several orders of magnitude. Nobody has demonstrated this attack against a configuration remotely approximating real-world conditions. We consider rowhammer mitigation to the job of the platform, not userspace software."&lt;br/&gt;[19:59] -ubottu:#ubuntu-security- bugzilla.mindrot.org bug 3656 in Portable OpenSSH "How to fix row hammer attacksï¼" [Security, New]&lt;br/&gt;[19:59] &lt;teward&gt; s/annotate the bug/annotate the CVE/&lt;br/&gt;[20:00] &lt;teward&gt; because it looks like the paper on this exploit is not possible in Real World Implementations&lt;br/&gt;[20:04] &lt;JanC&gt; so basically this is only relevant if you still use Ubuntu from before 2005?&lt;br/&gt;[20:05] &lt;teward&gt; JanC: from what i'm reading even latest OpenSSH in 24.04 is impacted, but upon additional diving into the linked CVE and its papers on arxiv and other documentation, it requires very specific circumstances to happen&lt;br/&gt;[20:06] &lt;teward&gt; and by very specific I mean modified sshd and a configuration that wouldn't be sane in the real world&lt;br/&gt;[20:10] &lt;JanC&gt; and when people change their sshd that's not Ubuntu's responsibility&lt;br/&gt;[20:11] &lt;teward&gt; correct&lt;br/&gt;[20:11] &lt;JanC&gt; also, I'd expect this to be mostly a problem on servers, but those would use ECC in most cases...&lt;br/&gt;[20:12] &lt;teward&gt; the core problem however is PCI/DSS compliance scans are stupid and don't take into account when these CVEs have very VERY specific *theoretical only* cases of exploit&lt;br/&gt;[20:12] &lt;teward&gt; hence the only reason i'm poking xD&lt;br/&gt;[20:12] &lt;JanC&gt; and I think ECC would prevent this exploit too?&lt;br/&gt;[20:14] &lt;JanC&gt; or at least make it much harder too&lt;br/&gt;[20:14] &lt;teward&gt; yeah that's the point any kind of implementation of ASLR makes it difficult, and Linux has had that since 2005 so&lt;br/&gt;[20:15] &lt;teward&gt; it makes it several orders of magnitude more difficult, and there's no real-world conditions approximated config nor stock OpenSSH confirmed affected by this, especially when we dig into the paper&lt;br/&gt;[20:15] &lt;teward&gt; this CVE probably should've been marked as an experimental or theory-only case and not a CVCSS 7.0 IMO&lt;br/&gt;[20:18] &lt;sdeziel&gt; the paper specifically calls out that ECC isn't a good defense: `in 2019 showed that the ECC countermeasure is not secure either`&lt;br/&gt;[20:20] &lt;JanC&gt; it might not be a full defence, but if your system suddenly gets a million ECC errors that would probably make the admins suspicious?  :)&lt;br/&gt;[20:27] &lt;sdeziel&gt; JanC: yeah that's also my understanding, I just wanted to mention that's no silver bullet unfortunately. HW is hard (too) it seems :)&lt;br/&gt;[20:53] &lt;teward&gt; sdeziel: we also have to keep in mind that there's a lot of mitigations that just *naturally* work and sane defaults tend to mitigate the risk by orders of magnitude&lt;br/&gt;[20:54] &lt;teward&gt; so default kernel ASLR and such, sane configis for a real-world setup, etc. seem to be the proper mitigations, and nobody's proposed or shown a *real world* usable exploit that isn't a shared-neighbor type local-only attack vector with user creds&lt;br/&gt;[20:58] &lt;sdeziel&gt; teward: I didn't read the paper but a quick look at it showed it talks about password auth which is indeed not a sane config&lt;br/&gt;[20:58] &lt;teward&gt; yeah i glanced it&lt;br/&gt;[21:06] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; teward: sure, I'll add the upstream bug to it tomorrow&lt;br/&gt;[21:07] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: thank you kindly&lt;br/&gt;[21:07] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; btw, pretty much everything is vulnerable to rowhammer issues and there's nothing we can do about it except stop using computers&lt;br/&gt;[21:07] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; every year someone comes out with a new practical attack&lt;br/&gt;[21:07] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: true. the problem is PCI/DSS compliance checks flag that as a problem&lt;br/&gt;[21:07] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; that isn't my problem :)&lt;br/&gt;[21:07] &lt;teward&gt; despite veryone KNOWING rowhammer is still a vulnerability&lt;br/&gt;[21:07] &lt;teward&gt; nope&lt;br/&gt;[21:08] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; I will add more details to the CVE tomorrow, I'll take another look at it&lt;br/&gt;[21:08] &lt;teward&gt; but as long as we annotate the bug with notes, etc. so people can JUSTIFY why it can't be fixed (there is no solution for rowhammer attacks!) things're better&lt;br/&gt;[21:08] &lt;teward&gt; cool cool mdeslaur thanks,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;# UBUNTU-MEETING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=== dviererbe1 is now known as dviererbe&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">25.04.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>24.04.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</title><description># UBUNTU-SECURITY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=== chris14_ is now known as chris14&lt;br/&gt;=== locutusofborg_ is now known as locutusofborg&lt;br/&gt;=== wete_ is now known as wete&lt;br/&gt;=== vx^ is now known as vx&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;# UBUNTU-MEETING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=== dviererbe1 is now known as dviererbe&lt;br/&gt;=== utkarsh51 is now known as utkarsh2102&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">24.04.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>23.04.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</title><description># UBUNTU-SECURITY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=== chris14_ is now known as chris14&lt;br/&gt;=== JanC is now known as Guest4088&lt;br/&gt;=== JanC is now known as Guest3279&lt;br/&gt;=== ahasenack_ is now known as ahasenack&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;# UBUNTU-MEETING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=== JanC is now known as Guest4088&lt;br/&gt;=== JanC is now known as Guest3279&lt;br/&gt;[14:30] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hey&lt;br/&gt;[14:31] &lt;didrocks&gt; o/ (for once, in a meeting, but mostly around)&lt;br/&gt;[14:31] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status&lt;br/&gt;[14:31] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting started at 14:31:27 UTC.

is this the old boto s3 support split out?&lt;br/&gt;[14:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; does anything else use this s3 support?&lt;br/&gt;[14:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; AFAICS boto3 and botocore are split out evolutions&lt;br/&gt;[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; s3transfer is only used by boto&lt;br/&gt;[14:50] &lt;sarnold&gt; do we actually care about s3 for simplestreams?&lt;br/&gt;[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; in fact it is only considered to be useful in boto3 as they evolve together&lt;br/&gt;[14:50] &lt;sarnold&gt; can we stub it out?&lt;br/&gt;[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; aciba: ^^ ?&lt;br/&gt;[14:51] &lt;aciba&gt; I think we can, I superficially grep cpc and mass code and they do not use it&lt;br/&gt;[14:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I assume the problem is that we might beak other users of that library if we'd remove s3 from boto3&lt;br/&gt;[14:51] &lt;aciba&gt; but I am not 100% sure&lt;br/&gt;[14:51] &lt;sarnold&gt; hmm. good point. sigh.&lt;br/&gt;[14:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; all those three are the newer set of libs&lt;br/&gt;[14:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and it would allow to demote the old unmaintained one&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; that is kind of what makes me suggest to let them in and demote the old&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and schedule but not wait for the security review&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;sarnold&gt; iff you can do both operations in the same minute...&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the code isn't new - it is just universe -&gt; main&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yeah - I can do both at once once ready&lt;br/&gt;[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; waiting for the tests by aciba&lt;br/&gt;[14:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we'd like to get this out of proposed by ~tomorrow I'd assume to not be in the way of RC images&lt;br/&gt;[14:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; aciba: can you get tests done by mid day tomorrow?&lt;br/&gt;[14:53] &lt;sarnold&gt; I think I'm coming around to your way of thinking, but I'm not real keen on "just wait until the last week" being used as a way to get beyond the MIR process.&lt;br/&gt;[14:53] &lt;eslerm_&gt; ^&lt;br/&gt;[14:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: I agree, but have no better option&lt;br/&gt;[14:53] &lt;aciba&gt; I have 3 MRs up, adding build tests and autopkg test, I am verifying autopkgtest work&lt;br/&gt;[14:53] &lt;sarnold&gt; cpaelzer: I mean, the kernel team had their kernels yanked from the upcoming release due to missing deadlines&lt;br/&gt;[14:54] &lt;aciba&gt; I think I could, assuming I have someone reviewing, pushing to -proposed&lt;br/&gt;[14:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and they add it back as we speak&lt;br/&gt;[14:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm unsure - should we vote&lt;br/&gt;[14:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; this isn't perfect and clean . otherwise we would have settled by now&lt;br/&gt;[14:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but even time for the meeting runs out :-/&lt;br/&gt;[14:55] &lt;sarnold&gt; heh :(&lt;br/&gt;[14:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so to get conclusion on this non-easy case ...&lt;br/&gt;[14:55] &lt;sarnold&gt; yeah, I'm fine with a vote&lt;br/&gt;[14:56] &lt;sarnold&gt; but I'd like us to consider how to avoid this situation in future cycles&lt;br/&gt;[14:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I guess we can be sure that noboday wanted or planned for this&lt;br/&gt;[14:56] &lt;eslerm_&gt; I would really like to see an unmaintained package leave main, otoh there is not time to review and s3 is something that certainly needs security review&lt;br/&gt;[14:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the problem is that simplestreams being in an ownership nimbus between teams&lt;br/&gt;[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; Calling for a vote +1 to let it in under the mentioned constraints (add tests, schedule security review, follow up on findings) -1 to keep the deprecated old python-boto&lt;br/&gt;[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; +1 (for a lack of a better option)&lt;br/&gt;[14:57] &lt;slyon&gt; +1 (same)&lt;br/&gt;[14:57] &lt;sarnold&gt; +1 (but grumpy about it)&lt;br/&gt;[14:57] &lt;eslerm_&gt; +/- 0 (non-vote)&lt;br/&gt;[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; joalif: didrocks: around?&lt;br/&gt;[14:58] &lt;joalif&gt; sorry in other meeting as well, +1&lt;br/&gt;[14:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks&lt;br/&gt;[14:58]  * cpaelzer is sad that there is nothing better&lt;br/&gt;[14:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but thanks for everyones understanding&lt;br/&gt;[14:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and thanks aciba to pick this up in the first place&lt;br/&gt;[14:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; or we would not even have that option to discuss&lt;br/&gt;[14:58] &lt;aciba&gt; thanks!&lt;br/&gt;[14:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; aciba: I'll later complete and post my review&lt;br/&gt;[14:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and let you know if there is something big other than waiting for tests&lt;br/&gt;[14:59] &lt;sarnold&gt; aciba: aye, yes, please don't take this personally. it's better to find and point it out. i'm just dissapointed that we didn't find this in the previous N cycles.&lt;br/&gt;[14:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'd then bring it up in tomorrow daily release meeting&lt;br/&gt;=== dviererbe1 is now known as dviererbe&lt;br/&gt;[14:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; to get an ack by release folks before moving it in (or killing it if they object)&lt;br/&gt;[14:59] &lt;aciba&gt; sweet thanks. yeah, totally not taken as personally!&lt;br/&gt;[14:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so the target to be ready is 4pm CET&lt;br/&gt;[15:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I think we are out of time&lt;br/&gt;[15:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; just quickly the lists ...&lt;br/&gt;[15:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #topic New MIRs&lt;br/&gt;[15:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt;

u-r-u offers to remove obsolete packages (mantic-noble/jammy-noble)&lt;br/&gt;[15:15] &lt;vorlon&gt; as I said in the bug comment I think this should be a raspi-specific quirk&lt;br/&gt;[15:15] &lt;vorlon&gt; since that's the supported platform whose kernel gets dropped&lt;br/&gt;[15:15] &lt;waveform&gt; indeed&lt;br/&gt;[15:15] &lt;juliank&gt; I think it should be a quirk for some "key packages"&lt;br/&gt;[15:15] &lt;vorlon&gt; and we shouldn't let users think they've upgraded to a supported LTS when the #1 CVE target is unsupported&lt;br/&gt;[15:16] &lt;juliank&gt; I mean block upgrades if any package they use from main got dropped&lt;br/&gt;[15:17] &lt;bdmurray&gt;

maybe you are building the image on your other arm64 hardware and then want to put it into a pi&lt;br/&gt;[15:21] &lt;juliank&gt; :D&lt;br/&gt;[15:21] &lt;waveform&gt; but the test is for "are we running on a pi?"&lt;br/&gt;[15:22] &lt;juliank&gt;

We don't have a way to allow for local customizations of child profiles, defined inside a profile?&lt;br/&gt;[13:46] &lt;ahasenack&gt; like this scenario: https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/bDgk4g3Q33/&lt;br/&gt;[13:47] &lt;ahasenack&gt; profile foo could be adapted via new config in local/foo (but not override explicit DENYs it might have, AIUI)&lt;br/&gt;[13:47] &lt;ahasenack&gt; but pofiles bar, ugh, and another, cannot be adapted&lt;br/&gt;[13:49] &lt;georgiag&gt; i guess you could add "include &lt;local/foobar&gt;" under profile bar&lt;br/&gt;[13:51] &lt;georgiag&gt; but yeah, that has not been done. I'm not sure if that's something just out of my head but I always saw child profiles as self contained so I didn't find it weird it didn't allow for customizations&lt;br/&gt;[13:55] &lt;ahasenack&gt; yeah, they are usually tailored to how the main application is calling the other executables, and not meant as a general profile&lt;br/&gt;[13:56] &lt;ahasenack&gt; for example, I have a dpkg child profile, and I'm 100% sure it would not be applicable as a general dpkg profile&lt;br/&gt;[13:56] &lt;ahasenack&gt; because I only care about how my app calls dpkg, and it's never in a "install a package for me" mode&lt;br/&gt;[13:56] &lt;ahasenack&gt; so the child profile is much simpler, and tighter&lt;br/&gt;[13:56] &lt;ahasenack&gt; but there could be bugs&lt;br/&gt;[13:56] &lt;ahasenack&gt; I guess I'm seeing this include from local as a way to work around bugs in the profile without having to change the main config file&lt;br/&gt;[14:00] &lt;georgiag&gt; ah right. I don't see local as a way to fix bugs. like for example if I want to compile my own qemu and have libvirt point to my own qemu instead, I would add it to local/usr.sbin.libvirtd. or having a config file in a non-default place and allowing it in the local profile, etc. the end result is the same&lt;br/&gt;[14:01] &lt;ahasenack&gt; well, one classical case of local overrides is home directories&lt;br/&gt;[14:01] &lt;ahasenack&gt; a home dir doesn't have to be in /home/$user :)&lt;br/&gt;[14:01] &lt;ahasenack&gt; classic snap complaint, btw&lt;br/&gt;[14:09] &lt;georgiag&gt; yep, thats true!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;# UBUNTU-MEETING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk&lt;br/&gt;=== JanC_ is now known as JanC&lt;br/&gt;=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk&lt;br/&gt;=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk&lt;br/&gt;=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk&lt;br/&gt;[15:29] &lt;sarnold&gt; good morning&lt;br/&gt;[15:29] &lt;eslerm_&gt; good morning o/&lt;br/&gt;[15:32] &lt;slyon&gt; heyho o/&lt;br/&gt;[15:33] &lt;slyon&gt; Looks like c_paelzer is out...&lt;br/&gt;[15:33] &lt;slyon&gt; I can run the meeting.

I can start with some questions.&lt;br/&gt;[19:05] &lt;mirespace&gt; ok&lt;br/&gt;[19:05] &lt;rbasak&gt; Where can you find details of the various freeze dates applicable to the current Ubuntu development release cycle? And what freeze applies to the archive at the moment?&lt;br/&gt;[19:05] &lt;mirespace&gt; In the  Noble Schedule: https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/noble-numbat-release-schedule/35649&lt;br/&gt;[19:06] &lt;mirespace&gt; We are in Feature Freeze&lt;br/&gt;[19:06] &lt;sil2100&gt; (/me will have a question when rbasak is done with his)&lt;br/&gt;[19:06] &lt;mirespace&gt; and also, you can find that info on IRC, the topic of #ubuntu-devel and #ubuntu-release on Libera Chat is generally updated to indicate the current freeze status.&lt;br/&gt;[19:07] &lt;rbasak&gt; sil2100: ack&lt;br/&gt;[19:08] &lt;rbasak&gt; mirespace: if a package is on version 1.2-3ubuntu1 and you're considering uploading 1.2.1-0ubuntu1, then what information do you need to decide if the upload would be acceptable during feature freeze?&lt;br/&gt;[19:09] &lt;mirespace&gt; the -0 before the ubuntu is telling that we are uploading a version from upstream that us not in Debian, and it would be acceptable if the diff between that versions includes fixes&lt;br/&gt;[19:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; Is there anything that might be present in the diff that would make the upload unacceptable?&lt;br/&gt;[19:11] &lt;mirespace&gt; cosmetic changes that makes the review more difficult and new features described in the changelog or CHANGES file&lt;br/&gt;[19:11] &lt;rbasak&gt; What if the diff contains new features that aren't described in the changelog or CHANGES file?&lt;br/&gt;[19:12] &lt;mirespace&gt; do you mean new features per se, not fixing/ or correcting a anormal behaviour?&lt;br/&gt;[19:13] &lt;rbasak&gt; Yes - so for example imagine that on examining the diff, you notice something that is without doubt a new feature.&lt;br/&gt;[19:14] &lt;mirespace&gt; So, we are talking about a MicroRelease upgrade, and we would need a microrelease exception in place (approved by the release team) to allow it&lt;br/&gt;[19:14] &lt;mirespace&gt; MRE&lt;br/&gt;[19:15] &lt;mirespace&gt; in thios case, the .1 before the -0 points to a microrelease upgrade&lt;br/&gt;[19:15] &lt;mirespace&gt; s/thios/thios/&lt;br/&gt;[19:15] &lt;mirespace&gt; aaah... *this&lt;br/&gt;[19:16] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK thanks.

Part of the template is the Regression Potential / Where problems could occur section. Can you tell me what it is for?&lt;br/&gt;[19:18] &lt;sil2100&gt; What is the purpose of that section?&lt;br/&gt;[19:18] &lt;mirespace&gt; With that part, the uploader demonstrates that the risk of the upload had been deeply considered&lt;br/&gt;[19:19] &lt;seb128&gt; o/ (queuing for a question after Lukasz)&lt;br/&gt;[19:19] &lt;mirespace&gt; Thinking about what else could occurs if my package lands in the archive... not only dfailures of the package itlself&lt;br/&gt;[19:19] &lt;mirespace&gt; also, how it could affect othe packages that usally interacts with it&lt;br/&gt;[19:20] &lt;mirespace&gt; or user/third party scripts that use any part of the package uploaded&lt;br/&gt;[19:20] &lt;sil2100&gt; Okay, second question:&lt;br/&gt;[19:21] &lt;sil2100&gt; 2) When you prepare and upload your SRU, and it gets accepted by the SRU team into -proposed, what are your next responsibilities regarding the SRU? What is expected of you?&lt;br/&gt;[19:22] &lt;mirespace&gt; me (or anyone else) should test the package in -proposed to verify the bug is fixed&lt;br/&gt;[19:22] &lt;mirespace&gt; with the test plan provided by me in the sru template&lt;br/&gt;[19:22] &lt;mirespace&gt; that is used to fill the bug&lt;br/&gt;[19:22] &lt;mirespace&gt; if the package, later, it's released because the aging period is reached&lt;br/&gt;[19:23] &lt;mirespace&gt; I should take a look to the component mistmached page to see if the package builds OK or have a regression (itself or with other packages)&lt;br/&gt;[19:24] &lt;mirespace&gt; I mean, taking care it passes the tests (DEP8) for the archs it builds&lt;br/&gt;[19:24] &lt;mirespace&gt; the comp0onent mismatche no, the update excuses, sorry&lt;br/&gt;[19:24] &lt;sil2100&gt; You mentioned component mismatches?&lt;br/&gt;[19:24] &lt;sil2100&gt; Ah, yes&lt;br/&gt;[19:24] &lt;sil2100&gt; This is what I wanted to see!&lt;br/&gt;[19:24] &lt;mirespace&gt; https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses.html&lt;br/&gt;[19:24] &lt;mirespace&gt; (too much MIR work lately, sorry)&lt;br/&gt;[19:25] &lt;mirespace&gt; :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:25] &lt;sil2100&gt; mirespace: this is the update_excuses page for the development series.

I linked the most recent MIRs for libtraceevent and libtracefs this morning&lt;br/&gt;[15:32] &lt;slyon&gt; libtraceevent is making some progress (patch adding tests needs review &amp; sponsoring), libtracefs is stuck currently reaching out for help from the Foundations system squad&lt;br/&gt;[15:33] &lt;slyon&gt; c-m-proposed: we have a bunch of new stuff in here..&lt;br/&gt;[15:33] &lt;slyon&gt; gst-plugins-good1.0 and roc-toolkit are desktop-packages. So I'd like to ask didrocks to investigate those (later on)&lt;br/&gt;[15:34] &lt;slyon&gt; jaraco.text and python-openstacksdk are ubuntu-openstack packages, for jamespage to look into.&lt;br/&gt;[15:34] &lt;slyon&gt; Everything else seems known/explained&lt;br/&gt;[15:34] &lt;jamespage&gt; will look&lt;br/&gt;[15:34] &lt;slyon&gt; thx!&lt;br/&gt;[15:34] &lt;slyon&gt; #topic New MIRs&lt;br/&gt;[15:34] &lt;slyon&gt; Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing&lt;br/&gt;[15:34] &lt;slyon&gt; #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&amp;orderby=-date_last_updated&amp;field.status%3Alist=NEW&amp;field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&amp;assignee_option=none&amp;field.assignee=&amp;field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir&lt;br/&gt;[15:35] &lt;slyon&gt; bug #2056099&lt;br/&gt;[15:35] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2056099 in tree (Ubuntu) "[MIR] tree" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2056099&lt;br/&gt;[15:35] &lt;slyon&gt; was this discussed last week?

#topic AOB&lt;br/&gt;[20:14] &lt;vorlon&gt; one item for AOB&lt;br/&gt;[20:14] &lt;vorlon&gt; I noticed when doing a "census" from the Release Team side of our LTS qualifications&lt;br/&gt;[20:14] &lt;vorlon&gt; that Ubuntu MATE doesn't appear to have applied yet for LTS status&lt;br/&gt;[20:14] &lt;vorlon&gt; does someone want to reach out to them and find out if they plan to?&lt;br/&gt;[20:14] &lt;seb128&gt; right, that was discussed yesterday during the flavors sync call&lt;br/&gt;[20:14] &lt;vorlon&gt; (it's fine if they don't do LTS, of course)&lt;br/&gt;[20:15] &lt;vorlon&gt; seb128: oh ok - what's the news?&lt;br/&gt;[20:15] &lt;seb128&gt; someone took an action item to reach to Martin to ask&lt;br/&gt;[20:15] &lt;seb128&gt; but the few people who had feedback said that the MATE team seems mostly inactive recently&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;seb128&gt; ah, someone was Mauro&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;vorlon&gt; that's fine then&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;seb128&gt; (just checked the meeting note)&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;vorlon&gt; I just didn't want this to slip by unnoticed&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;amurray&gt; there is a topic over in their discourse but I don't see anything definitive there&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;vorlon&gt; since the MATE team's communications preferences seem misaligned with the Release Team's and the Tech Board's these days&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;amurray&gt; #link https://ubuntu-mate.community/t/plans-for-24-04-lts/27110/4&lt;br/&gt;[20:17] &lt;seb128&gt; amurray, right, I think that one was used as a basis for the claim that the dev team isn't responsive/around much recently&lt;br/&gt;[20:19] &lt;amurray&gt; I'll ask in that thread as well and tag Martin as well&lt;br/&gt;[20:19] &lt;seb128&gt; amurray, thanks (and maybe check first with Mauro if he already did since he took an action about it yesterday)&lt;br/&gt;[20:19] &lt;seb128&gt; well I mean reaching out to them&lt;br/&gt;[20:20] &lt;seb128&gt; though I guess a public post wouldn't hurt in any case&lt;br/&gt;[20:20] &lt;vorlon&gt; Martin *did* come to the Ubuntu Summit so it's not entirely moribund?&lt;br/&gt;[20:20] &lt;amurray&gt; yeah I think its fine for the TB to enquire for our own purposes - it would definitely be a shame for MATE to not be part of the LTS&lt;br/&gt;[20:20] &lt;vorlon&gt; again, it's fine if a flavor doesn't want to do LTS support&lt;br/&gt;[20:21] &lt;seb128&gt; right, well let's see what they reply&lt;br/&gt;[20:21] &lt;vorlon&gt; just don't want to make sure that's a conscious decision (or the outcome of an assessment of the flavor's capacity), not an accident of timing&lt;br/&gt;[20:21] &lt;vorlon&gt;

I explained that bad. I meant integer, not odd&lt;br/&gt;[20:28] &lt;mesebrec&gt; The number here is wrong because the CC is part of the team (for technical reasons) https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-membership-board/+members#active&lt;br/&gt;[20:30] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; as we have 6 members it's floor((6/2)+1) = floor(3+1) = 4. if we had 7 it'ld be floor((7/2)+1) = floor(3.5+1) = 4&lt;br/&gt;[20:31] &lt;mesebrec&gt; oh&lt;br/&gt;[20:37] &lt;cangreja533&gt; Hello, warm greetings from Colombia&lt;br/&gt;[20:37] &lt;mesebrec&gt; Ok, the Matrix Council is having a meeting now, but we can jump back here if quorum is reached&lt;br/&gt;[20:37] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; ok&lt;br/&gt;[20:38] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; we'll try to get things sorted via email asap if that's the decision&lt;br/&gt;[20:38] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; we also still have the second meeting slot today if we can't get quorum by the end of this slot&lt;br/&gt;[20:38] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; so sorry about this&lt;br/&gt;[20:39] &lt;mesebrec&gt; No problem, it happens!&lt;br/&gt;[20:39] &lt;mesebrec&gt; If it's a persistent problem, feel free to ask the CC for help and we can see if we can do interim elections or provide some replacements.&lt;br/&gt;[20:40] &lt;ic3br34ker77&gt; no worries lads, It's understandable, it happens.&lt;br/&gt;[20:40] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; cangreja533: Welcome - are you too going to be a participant in FLiSoL Barranquilla ?&lt;br/&gt;[20:43] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; thank you, mesebrec.

At this point, I am looking for anything to make it easier.&lt;br/&gt;[21:03] &lt;sarnold&gt; wuzamarine: hah, yeah, i'm familiar with that .. ipfwadm was easy enough but then they introduced ipchains. ipchains was annoying so I switched to ipf. then ipf was replaced with pf. then just when I was starting to learn ipchains they introduced iptables. and then just when I was getting around to learning iptables they introduced nftables. who even knows how long this one is going to last..&lt;br/&gt;[21:11] &lt;JanC&gt; ufw has been good enough for what I need recently, but almost a couple decades ago I used shorewall; no idea how it compares nowadays...&lt;br/&gt;[21:11] &lt;JanC&gt; and there are other tools/frontends too&lt;br/&gt;[21:12] &lt;JanC&gt; even ufw might work for what you are trying to do, but it's been a long time since I did anything complicated with it...   :)&lt;br/&gt;[21:14] &lt;JanC&gt; certainly port 25 just works for me...&lt;br/&gt;[21:17] &lt;JanC&gt; (but it's probably a different ufw version)&lt;br/&gt;[21:18] &lt;JanC&gt; are you certain fail2ban or knockd aren't causing your issues?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;# UBUNTU-MEETING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=== flexiondotorg is now known as Wimpy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">06.03.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>05.03.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</title><description># UBUNTU-SECURITY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=== chris14_ is now known as chris14&lt;br/&gt;=== ChanServ changed the topic of #ubuntu-security to: Twitter: @ubuntu_sec || https://usn.ubuntu.com || https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam || https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features || Community: mdeslaur&lt;br/&gt;[11:25] &lt;frickler&gt; mdeslaur: ^^ twitter is gone, how about some nice mastodon acc instead?&lt;br/&gt;[12:08] &lt;ebarretto&gt; amurray, fyi too ^ &lt;br/&gt;=== ChanServ changed the topic of #ubuntu-security to: Mastodon: @ubuntusecurity@fosstodon.org || https://usn.ubuntu.com || https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam || https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features || Community: mdeslaur&lt;br/&gt;[12:10] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; ask, and you shall receive :)&lt;br/&gt;[12:10] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; hrm, should I write Fediverse there, or is Mastodon appropriate?&lt;br/&gt;[12:12] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; I guess Mastodon is ok until others become more popular&lt;br/&gt;[12:32] &lt;frickler&gt; wow, that was fast, thx :)&lt;br/&gt;[12:35] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; frickler: np :)&lt;br/&gt;[15:55] &lt;JanC&gt; it *is* Mastodon, so calling it Mastodon can't wrong  :)&lt;br/&gt;=== JanC is now known as Guest3312&lt;br/&gt;=== JanC_ is now known as JanC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;# UBUNTU-MEETING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk&lt;br/&gt;[15:30] &lt;sarnold&gt; good morning&lt;br/&gt;[15:31] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hey&lt;br/&gt;[15:31] &lt;eslerm_&gt; greetings from 34k" over the dakotas o/&lt;br/&gt;[15:31] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; noble is completely time_t'ed - let us see how that looks in the reports&lt;br/&gt;[15:31] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status&lt;br/&gt;[15:31] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting started at 15:31:53 UTC.

I noticed that cvescan databases (https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cvescan/) stopped updating a couple of days ago. Is this just some flakiness, or did we get to the final nail in the coffin for this project?&lt;br/&gt;[11:16] &lt;ebarretto&gt; mpiano, probably some issue in the server, but we should take this as the final coffin as the project has been unsupported for more than an year now &lt;br/&gt;[11:19] &lt;mpiano&gt; ebarretto, I'm ready to bet it's somehow related to handling the leap year.

Is this expected to only have gcr4 at some point, if so when?&lt;br/&gt;[15:46] &lt;slyon&gt; I'd assume that depends on GTK3 usage in main..?&lt;br/&gt;[15:47] &lt;jbicha&gt; I can't give you an exact time since seahorse &amp; shotwell are undermaintained &amp; porting to gtk4 is a lot for big apps&lt;br/&gt;[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I see, so it really is once all GTK3 in main are gone some day&lt;br/&gt;[15:47] &lt;jbicha&gt; the old gcr will be in universe for a long time&lt;br/&gt;[15:47] &lt;jbicha&gt; yes&lt;br/&gt;[15:47] &lt;seb128&gt; hey there, sorry I wanted to join but I've another call at the same time and forgot to /j on IRC&lt;br/&gt;[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm personally fine with that TBH&lt;br/&gt;[15:48] &lt;seb128&gt; jbicha, thanks for covering for desktop :)&lt;br/&gt;[15:48] &lt;slyon&gt; Considering it's a versioned transition and we have precedence for parallel GTK3 &amp; GTK4 I'm +1 on promoting this.

Considering that things are moving in the right direction (security review progressing, upstream work on the dbus-run-session equivalent), I was just wondering if there are any plans to make that switch for 24.04?&lt;br/&gt;[16:26] &lt;seb128&gt; I would love to see that happen but it doesn't seem like things align enough for it?&lt;br/&gt;[16:26] &lt;slyon&gt; seb128: I think most recent discussions (from last week? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dbus-broker/+bug/2015538/comments/19) revealed that we'd be willing to have it split into individual binary packages. So that src:dbus and src:dbus-broker could be in main at the same time, but only with the relevant binary packages (dbus-broker daemon + dbus policy)&lt;br/&gt;[16:26] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2015538 in dbus-broker (Ubuntu) "[MIR] dbus-broker" [Undecided, Incomplete]&lt;br/&gt;[16:28] &lt;seb128&gt; slyon, we had that discussion at the time we had the first review round iirc, but someone pointed out (mdeslaur?) back then that dbus-run-session depends on the dbus service&lt;br/&gt;[16:28] &lt;seb128&gt; I didn't have the free slots to read the code to see if that's true&lt;br/&gt;[16:28] &lt;seb128&gt; but assuming that's a true fact it means we can't do the split/demote dbus service thing&lt;br/&gt;[16:29] &lt;seb128&gt; if I understand correctly what you want to split (dbus-session-run in main, dbus in universe, right?)&lt;br/&gt;[16:31] &lt;slyon&gt; I think the idea was to get the upstream dbus-broker dbus-run-session equivalent integrated, so that we could demote dbus and dbus-run-session to universe, while keeping the src:dbus policy bits, which are not shipped by dbus-broker on purpose.&lt;br/&gt;[16:31] &lt;slyon&gt; But doing that split and integration work would need somebody with capacity to drive it&lt;br/&gt;[16:33] &lt;slyon&gt; comment #17 also suggest that there is no such hard dependency, which would give even more options: "In Debian we just keep both, dbus-run-session from the src:dbus package works just fine, and it can be installed in parallel without any issues when somebody needs it. So it doesn't seem to me that you need that separate implementation?"&lt;br/&gt;[16:33] &lt;slyon&gt; But it needs checking the details&lt;br/&gt;[16:35] &lt;seb128&gt; slyon, ack, thanks for the details&lt;br/&gt;[16:35] &lt;seb128&gt; it's on my backlog, I doubt I will get to it this week though but I'm still interested, maybe we manage to squeeze a ffe next week for it if things turn out to not be too complicated&lt;br/&gt;[16:36] &lt;seb128&gt; the fact that the new binary is written in rust is annoying it means it's not a simple patch to drop it&lt;br/&gt;[17:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: I could demote it, but this needs an extra exclude or it would come just back&lt;br/&gt;[17:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: it only has https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/ubuntu-seeds/+git/ubuntu/tree/supported#n214&lt;br/&gt;[18:05] &lt;slyon&gt; cpaelzer: good catch!

Hopefully that's helpful, though with Gunnar gone I'm not sure who's left :-(&lt;br/&gt;[20:11] &lt;vorlon&gt; the thread had gone in that direction but maybe we just need to have that information available and don't need to consider it a blocker?&lt;br/&gt;[20:11] &lt;sgmoore&gt; I know we need a proper packageset, but other than that, how are we looking :) I am working hard on getting a spectacular release ready :)&lt;br/&gt;[20:11] &lt;vorlon&gt; rbasak: :/&lt;br/&gt;[20:13] &lt;seb128&gt; rbasak, I think I'm the only standing member left to deal with some of those translations things :/&lt;br/&gt;[20:14] &lt;seb128&gt; I need to sort that out somehow and find other people to involve&lt;br/&gt;[20:14] &lt;seb128&gt; if anyone is reading and want to help with translations please msg me&lt;br/&gt;[20:15] &lt;vorlon&gt; sgmoore: so I guess amurray who isn't here today was on point for driving the Kubuntu discussion.  I'll work on getting my action item sorted one way or the other so we can have a sane conversation about a packageset. From my perspective personally, that shouldn't be a blocker for LTS qualification but amurray will need to call the vote&lt;br/&gt;[20:15] &lt;sil2100&gt; The only thing I can commit to, sadly, is operating the machinery&lt;br/&gt;[20:15] &lt;rbasak&gt; seb128: IMHO, you should "close" those MLs and venues and bring everything into one place - ubuntu-devel@, or Discourse.

Let me get started. When is feature freeze please, and how would you find that information?&lt;br/&gt;[19:09] &lt;vpa1977&gt; I will be looking at https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/noble-numbat-release-schedule/35649&lt;br/&gt;[19:09] &lt;vpa1977&gt; The current deadline is 29 feb&lt;br/&gt;[19:09] &lt;rbasak&gt; If you need a feature freeze exception, what's the process?&lt;br/&gt;[19:10] &lt;vpa1977&gt; I will be raising a bug explaining the need for the feature freeze, proposed changes and their impact&lt;br/&gt;[19:10] &lt;vpa1977&gt; I will provide a test plan and subscribe ubuntu-release&lt;br/&gt;[19:10] &lt;vpa1977&gt; *need for the feature freeze exception&lt;br/&gt;[19:11] &lt;vpa1977&gt; The bug will have a debdiff/MP attached and the associated test logs&lt;br/&gt;[19:11] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK. Let's say that we have version 1.2-3 packaged, upstream have released 1.2.1, and feature freeze is in effect. Would an upload of 1.2.1 be permitted without an exception, or, if you need more information, what information would that be?&lt;br/&gt;[19:12] &lt;vpa1977&gt; I will review changelogs to identify if it is a bugfix release&lt;br/&gt;[19:12] &lt;vpa1977&gt; In this case it is allowed to request a feature freeze&lt;br/&gt;[19:12] &lt;vpa1977&gt; exception&lt;br/&gt;[19:12] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK. Let's say that it is a bugfix release. What package versions string would you expect to use for your upload?&lt;br/&gt;[19:12] &lt;rbasak&gt; *package version string&lt;br/&gt;[19:13] &lt;vpa1977&gt; It depends if it is Ubuntu specific or debian package. For ubuntu it will be 1.2.1-0ubuntu1 for debian it will be 1.2.1~us1-0ubuntu1&lt;br/&gt;[19:13] &lt;vpa1977&gt; reason for ~us1 is that original tarballs are not reproducible in some cases&lt;br/&gt;[19:13] &lt;vpa1977&gt; and the repack suffix will allow sync with debian&lt;br/&gt;[19:14] &lt;rbasak&gt; Good answer :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:14] &lt;vpa1977&gt; (not reproducible e.g. when used xz compression)&lt;br/&gt;[19:14] &lt;rbasak&gt; Let me move on to transitions&lt;br/&gt;[19:15] &lt;rbasak&gt; In the usual case, how would you verify if an upload you're considering making would introduce a transition or not?&lt;br/&gt;[19:15] &lt;vpa1977&gt; The transition will happen when there are API/ABI changes in the package providing a build dependency (e.g. time_t)&lt;br/&gt;[19:15] &lt;vpa1977&gt; Or the toolchain changes such as Java 21&lt;br/&gt;[19:16] &lt;vpa1977&gt; *build or runtime dependency&lt;br/&gt;[19:17] &lt;vpa1977&gt; In this case all dependant package will need to migrate together to ensure that there are no breaks&lt;br/&gt;[19:17] &lt;sil2100&gt; I'll have an unrelated question when you're done&lt;br/&gt;[19:17] &lt;rbasak&gt; Let's say that the package is src:foo, which generates binary package libfoo1. You're about to update a new major version of src:foo, and you have a test build ready in a PPA. Is there something you can see easily by inspection from the web UI that would instantly tell you if there's an ABI break if this is a normal case with nothing special going on?&lt;br/&gt;[19:19] &lt;vpa1977&gt; From the web UI i can the major version change, but I would be looking at reverse-depends and reverse-depends -b to see if it has any dependencies&lt;br/&gt;[19:19] &lt;vpa1977&gt; and rebuild those /autopkgtest in the ppa&lt;br/&gt;[19:19] &lt;vpa1977&gt; I apologise if I am taking the long route here.&lt;br/&gt;[19:19] &lt;vpa1977&gt; But library bumping a major version indicates some kind of break&lt;br/&gt;[19:20] &lt;rbasak&gt; It doesn't necessarily mean it's an ABI break.&lt;br/&gt;[19:20] &lt;rbasak&gt; What would be the difference, in terms of binary packages generated?&lt;br/&gt;[19:21] &lt;vpa1977&gt; Meaning what constitutes the ABI break? Change of function parameters, removal of a function&lt;br/&gt;[19:21] &lt;vpa1977&gt; Change of the exported structures&lt;br/&gt;[19:21] &lt;rbasak&gt; Assume that it is correctly declared by the packaging&lt;br/&gt;[19:22] &lt;rbasak&gt; What would be externally visible in the packaging that would indicate the ABI break?&lt;br/&gt;[19:22] &lt;vpa1977&gt; as in from launchpad UI ?&lt;br/&gt;[19:23] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm suggesting that it's possible to see from Launchpad web UI what I'm asking for, yes.&lt;br/&gt;[19:23] &lt;rbasak&gt; Assuming you have a PPA test build ready&lt;br/&gt;[19:24] &lt;vpa1977&gt; hmm... I fail to answer that ;( without looking inside package / at the sources ;(&lt;br/&gt;[19:25] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK let's move on.&lt;br/&gt;[19:25] &lt;rbasak&gt; sil2100: you said you had a question?&lt;br/&gt;[19:25] &lt;vpa1977&gt; (please share the answer later =) )&lt;br/&gt;[19:25] &lt;sil2100&gt; Yes, I had an SRU related question!&lt;br/&gt;[19:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; I see that you did do a few SRUs, but I just want to make sure. When requesting an SRU, the template requires putting a "Where problems could occur"/"Regression Potential" section&lt;br/&gt;[19:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; Can you tell me what is the purpose of it?&lt;br/&gt;[19:27] &lt;sil2100&gt; What do we want the SRU requesters to do as part of the preparation of this section?&lt;br/&gt;[19:28] &lt;teward&gt; *shows up late*&lt;br/&gt;[19:28] &lt;teward&gt; (I had no internet until now sorry, technician was on site fixing the fiber link)&lt;br/&gt;[19:28] &lt;vladimirp&gt; sorry disconnect&lt;br/&gt;[19:29] &lt;vladimirp&gt; Not sure if the answer got through : the section identifies extended test plan that tries to identify possible regressions/impact on users due to the change&lt;br/&gt;[19:29] &lt;sil2100&gt; Thanks o/&lt;br/&gt;[19:30] &lt;sil2100&gt; I have no further questions&lt;br/&gt;[19:31] &lt;kanashiro&gt; all the answers so far and the endorsements are enough for me to vote&lt;br/&gt;[19:32]  * rbasak is pondering whether he has further questions&lt;br/&gt;[19:33] &lt;rbasak&gt; vladimirp: let's say that an upload might have resulted in a component mismatch. Where would you confirm whether this is the case or not, and what are the options available to resolve a component mismatch?&lt;br/&gt;[19:33] &lt;vladimirp&gt; Lets say I have introduced a dependency on main package which is currently in universe.&lt;br/&gt;[19:34] &lt;vladimirp&gt; In this case I will need to go through MIR process first to move my dependency from universe to main before uploading the package.&lt;br/&gt;[19:34] &lt;vladimirp&gt; I can rollback the change by uploading the fix that removes the dependency (if possible)&lt;br/&gt;[19:35] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK, thanks.&lt;br/&gt;[19:35] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm ready to vote.&lt;br/&gt;[19:35] &lt;rbasak&gt; teward: do you have any questions?&lt;br/&gt;[19:35] &lt;teward&gt; nope, on account you and others have asked the questions I had :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:35] &lt;teward&gt; and also apologies for my being late, I hate being late but when I have no internet...&lt;br/&gt;[19:36] &lt;rbasak&gt; #vote Grant Vladimir Petko core dev&lt;br/&gt;[19:36] &lt;meetingology&gt; Please vote on: Grant Vladimir Petko core dev&lt;br/&gt;[19:36] &lt;meetingology&gt; Public votes can be registered by saying +1, -1 or +0 in channel (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1|-1|+0 #channelname')&lt;br/&gt;[19:36] &lt;sil2100&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[19:36] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 received from sil2100&lt;br/&gt;[19:36] &lt;kanashiro&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[19:36] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 received from kanashiro&lt;br/&gt;[19:36] &lt;teward&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[19:36] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 received from teward&lt;br/&gt;[19:38] &lt;rbasak&gt; +1 I think a couple of answers fell a little short of my expectations, but your endorsements speak well of your tendency to be thoughful and ask questions before acting.

I'll be working on it as time allows, ideally before the next DMB meeting.&lt;br/&gt;[19:47] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; *see the opportunity for them&lt;br/&gt;[19:47] &lt;sil2100&gt; It's a good start I see&lt;br/&gt;[19:48] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Anyway, I'll be here for the next meeting, if you all would like to discuss further progress at that point. :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:48] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; sil2100: thanks :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:48] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; (EOF)&lt;br/&gt;[19:48]  * rbasak is back&lt;br/&gt;[19:49] &lt;rbasak&gt; tsimonq2: that looks great. Thank you!&lt;br/&gt;[19:50] &lt;rbasak&gt; tsimonq2: I don't know if you're aware of https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RobieBasak/DMB/CoreDev&lt;br/&gt;[19:50] &lt;rbasak&gt; That's just my opinion - I think we were hoping to try and get that adjusted according DMB consensus and then share that more widely.&lt;br/&gt;[19:50] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; rbasak: Nope, but now I am :D this is meant to be a shorter reference anyway, with links to something like that.&lt;br/&gt;[19:51] &lt;rbasak&gt; That would be fine I think. The issue (at the DMB end) is that we vary in opinion, but that makes it hard for applicants.&lt;br/&gt;[19:51] &lt;rbasak&gt; It'd be nice to find/negotiate common ground, tweaking as necessary, and have an official DMB opinion.&lt;br/&gt;[19:51] &lt;rbasak&gt; Anyway, thank you again for working on this.&lt;br/&gt;[19:51] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; I documented this for Lubuntu a while back: https://git.lubuntu.me/lubuntu-wiki/wiki/wiki/lubuntu-dev - might be worth exploring.&lt;br/&gt;[19:51] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; rbasak: I completely agree :) thanks for considering it!&lt;br/&gt;[19:52] &lt;rbasak&gt; Indeed - that looks like it'd be useful input to a final DMB opinion too!&lt;br/&gt;[19:52] &lt;rbasak&gt; Anything else on this to discuss for now?&lt;br/&gt;[19:52] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; I'm good if you all are good :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:52] &lt;rbasak&gt; Any other business?&lt;br/&gt;[19:54] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; vpa1977 wanted to know the answer to the question about transitions that rbasak asked?&lt;br/&gt;[19:54] &lt;rbasak&gt; The binary package generated would have changed from libfoo1 to libfoo2. That's what triggers a "normal" transition - libfoo1 would become uninstallable (and/or NBS) were the package to migrate.&lt;br/&gt;[19:55] &lt;rbasak&gt; Though I think vladimirp might have already understood this and it was just a mismatch in communication!&lt;br/&gt;[19:55] &lt;rbasak&gt; I find it quite hard to phrase questions to avoid that sort of thing, without giving away my expected answers.&lt;br/&gt;[19:55] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; which is exactly what happened to me when you hit me with a near-identical question last January&lt;br/&gt;[19:56] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; :P&lt;br/&gt;[19:56] &lt;vladimirp&gt; I was thinking - I have a package to review and needs to find if it contains an ABI break.&lt;br/&gt;[19:56] &lt;vladimirp&gt; Could have mentioned abi-compliance-checker (but its a nightmare)&lt;br/&gt;[19:57] &lt;vladimirp&gt; Plus C++ only&lt;br/&gt;[19:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; arraybolt3: indeed :)&lt;br/&gt;[19:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; I guess the meeting's done though then?&lt;br/&gt;[19:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; #endmeeting&lt;br/&gt;[19:57] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting ended at 19:57:47 UTC.

I welcome feedback on how I ask questions, too!&lt;br/&gt;[19:58] &lt;rbasak&gt; Though I need to go now. I will catch up later.&lt;br/&gt;[19:58] &lt;kanashiro&gt; o/&lt;br/&gt;[19:58] &lt;teward&gt; tsimonq2: i'm stealing you btw&lt;br/&gt;[20:01] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; teward: ok lol&lt;br/&gt;[20:06] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; rbasak: Part of the difficult thing about being on the DMB is, in order to ask the right questions, you need to know your audience for the questions. Many assumptions can be made through reviewing debdiffs, but until there is something clear saying "this is a MOTU, this is a Core Dev," the DMB has a large amount of flexibility on what it can ask.&lt;br/&gt;[20:06] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Now, I'm not suggesting we go full Debian Developer and have pre-written questions. There should, however, be something saying "these are the kinds of questions you can expect."&lt;br/&gt;[20:07] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; If there's one thing I've heard from candidates privately that sticks out, it is "I'm scared for the meeting because they could ask anything," and quite honestly, that's the truth. As an existing Ubuntu Developer, it's fun to see, but I remember it being a very anxiety-prone process to go through.&lt;br/&gt;[20:08] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; That was the catalyst for writing that reference document above, to get something solid started on this front, to benefit every applicant that comes after Vladimir.&lt;br/&gt;=== _doko is now known as doko&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">19.02.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>18.02.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</title><description># UBUNTU-SECURITY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=== JanC is now known as Guest2833&lt;br/&gt;=== JanC_ is now known as JanC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;# UBUNTU-MEETING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=== JanC is now known as Guest2833&lt;br/&gt;=== JanC_ is now known as JanC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">18.02.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>17.02.2024: ubuntu-security</title><description># UBUNTU-SECURITY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=== chris14_ is now known as chris14&lt;br/&gt;[13:35] &lt;rouca&gt; eslerm: any news of sendmail ?&lt;br/&gt;[14:37] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/resources-for-development-related-tasks/42544 :)&lt;br/&gt;=== wete_ is now known as wete&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">17.02.2024: ubuntu-security</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>16.02.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</title><description># UBUNTU-SECURITY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=== chris14_ is now known as chris14&lt;br/&gt;=== chris14_ is now known as chris14&lt;br/&gt;=== JanC is now known as Guest6865&lt;br/&gt;=== JanC_ is now known as JanC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;# UBUNTU-MEETING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk&lt;br/&gt;=== JanC is now known as Guest6865&lt;br/&gt;=== JanC_ is now known as JanC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">16.02.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>15.02.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</title><description># UBUNTU-SECURITY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=== chris14_ is now known as chris14&lt;br/&gt;[08:53] &lt;rouca&gt; eslerm: just send you a patch&lt;br/&gt;[08:54] &lt;rouca&gt; eslerm: forget to mention it was against bookworm&lt;br/&gt;=== JanC is now known as Guest1755&lt;br/&gt;=== JanC_ is now known as JanC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;# UBUNTU-MEETING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk&lt;br/&gt;=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk&lt;br/&gt;=== JanC is now known as Guest1755&lt;br/&gt;=== JanC_ is now known as JanC&lt;br/&gt;=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk&lt;br/&gt;=== rkratky__ is now known as rkratky&lt;br/&gt;[16:01] &lt;juliank&gt; #startmeeting Weekly Ubuntu Foundations team&lt;br/&gt;[16:01] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting started at 16:01:26 UTC.

let us cheeck&lt;br/&gt;[15:32] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; they are approved at least by the color&lt;br/&gt;[15:32] &lt;slyon&gt; yes, that's what I did earlier today :)&lt;br/&gt;[15:32] &lt;slyon&gt; besides those, kexec-tools looks new to me&lt;br/&gt;[15:32] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yes, they can be promoted&lt;br/&gt;[15:32] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'll do so tomorrow if no one beats me to it&lt;br/&gt;[15:32] &lt;slyon&gt; thanks!&lt;br/&gt;[15:33] &lt;sarnold&gt; i'm surprised the kexec-tools owner is ~canonical-ubuntu-qa&lt;br/&gt;[15:33] &lt;sarnold&gt; I expected kernel team ;)&lt;br/&gt;[15:33] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it is the kernel team&lt;br/&gt;[15:33] &lt;sarnold&gt; (maybe foundations..)&lt;br/&gt;[15:33] &lt;slyon&gt; It shows ~kernel-packages for me&lt;br/&gt;[15:33] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/m-r-package-team-mapping.html&lt;br/&gt;[15:33] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; some are subscribed by multiple which breaks some checks&lt;br/&gt;[15:33] &lt;sarnold&gt; aha&lt;br/&gt;[15:34] &lt;slyon&gt; but yes, QA is subscribed, too&lt;br/&gt;[15:34] &lt;sarnold&gt; I was going by bug subscribers https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kexec-tools&lt;br/&gt;[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; this is added in kexec-tools (1:2.0.25-1)&lt;br/&gt;[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt;

xnox: did&lt;br/&gt;[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hi xnox, do you think we should remove the recommends to xen from kexec-tools or do you want to pursue this in any other way?&lt;br/&gt;[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt;

to balance the load?&lt;br/&gt;[15:40] &lt;eslerm&gt; bpf bugs mention they are WIP, but the outstanding issues seemed small enough that I encourged submitting them (missing unit tests)&lt;br/&gt;[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt;

There are two ways we can do this&lt;br/&gt;[15:41] &lt;eslerm&gt; I wouldn't mind foing a review for the MIR team if that is okay&lt;br/&gt;[15:41] &lt;eslerm&gt; doing*&lt;br/&gt;[15:41] &lt;joalif&gt;

If you cannot find anyone else assign a bug to me but then again no promises for next week&lt;br/&gt;[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; joalif: as long as not all of them are piling up and are done never it is ok to take a while each&lt;br/&gt;[15:42] &lt;jamespage&gt; cpaelzer: yep&lt;br/&gt;[15:42] &lt;joalif&gt; ok then&lt;br/&gt;[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I assigned langtable to joalif&lt;br/&gt;[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks jamespage - giving you bpftrace&lt;br/&gt;[15:42] &lt;joalif&gt;

ok we see the libtrace* things going back&lt;br/&gt;[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; mostly being great and ok actually, but missing some better QA&lt;br/&gt;[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; one done by didrocks, one by me&lt;br/&gt;[15:45] &lt;slyon&gt; cc upils: ^&lt;br/&gt;[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: of the team prefers, there is the option to do autopkgtests once and awesome just on the high level&lt;br/&gt;[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I suggested to that in my review&lt;br/&gt;[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; like&lt;br/&gt;[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; a) get the build time tests to be better, seems didrocks found the same in his review&lt;br/&gt;[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but also&lt;br/&gt;[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; b) autopkgtests are weak&lt;br/&gt;[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but for (b)&lt;br/&gt;[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; that can be done in-pkg&lt;br/&gt;[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; or it can be done on the level that pulls it in, which here is trace-cmd&lt;br/&gt;[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; there is might be easier to write non trivial tests&lt;br/&gt;[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and if made sure that this uses both libs, that might be adressing 3-for-1&lt;br/&gt;[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; all other incomplete cases in this list are much older&lt;br/&gt;[15:47] &lt;slyon&gt; right. This is for upils to look into. Potentially doing proper autopkgtests for trace-cmd only&lt;br/&gt;[15:47] &lt;sarnold&gt; tracing the autopkgtest runner kernels might be a challenge&lt;br/&gt;[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yeah slyon, if done right that would cover all three at once&lt;br/&gt;[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: we have testcases which spawn VMs to have control and avoid weird effects&lt;br/&gt;[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; this could be another one of those&lt;br/&gt;[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; mark them big to have enough mem/cpu and set it up that way&lt;br/&gt;[15:48] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; o/ MIR team! Sorry to butt in, I just wanted to bring this to your attention: https://tracker.debian.org/news/1493585/accepted-ubuntu-dev-tools-0198-source-into-unstable/ - I am quite happy to accept any feedback if you have it. :)&lt;br/&gt;[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; not saing it has to be that way, but it helps to have control and avoid flakyness&lt;br/&gt;[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hi tsimonq2, you are totally fine to interrupt&lt;br/&gt;[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; having a look ...&lt;br/&gt;[15:49] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Those are just some slight tweaks I found useful for check-mir.

this is still ongoing&lt;br/&gt;[20:21] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; o/ I'm a stand-in for Kubuntu today, and just wanted to provide some context (nothing actionable.) Scarlett Gately Moore has been working for the Kubuntu Council now, officially, on a contract basis. I have been tasked with guiding her through so she re-learns the ropes. There has been enough progress and energy in the Kubuntu Team where I am confident in saying we should be re-qualified. I'm&lt;br/&gt;[20:21] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; happy to answer any specific questions if there are any today, because I have been deeply involved in this effort.&lt;br/&gt;[20:22] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Rik is still around and involved, providing guidance on the precedent he has set over the past few years, to be clear.&lt;br/&gt;[20:23] &lt;amurray&gt; hey tsimonq2 - at this stage I don't have any specific questions, I'll probably just continue to follow up via email - I did notice scarlett said they would intend to support the entire kubuntu packageset (which is great!) but I worry about whether they have the resources for this?&lt;br/&gt;[20:23] &lt;vorlon&gt; that all seems reasonable, and Kubuntu is established enough that I'm personally not worried about a change of lead impacting the LTS qual&lt;br/&gt;[20:24] &lt;vorlon&gt; amurray: could you elaborate as to what's in the kubuntu packageset that's not KDE?&lt;br/&gt;[20:24] &lt;vorlon&gt; we do a poor job of gardening packagesets&lt;br/&gt;[20:24] &lt;vorlon&gt; there's probably a bunch of stuff listed that doesn't even exist in the archive anymore&lt;br/&gt;[20:25] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; vorlon: I understand this isn't necessarily what we want to do going forward, but yes, that list has quite grown over time.&lt;br/&gt;[20:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; doesn't have to be done here and now, anyway; this could be a mail followup&lt;br/&gt;[20:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; but I'd like to get into the nitty-gritty of the capacity concerns&lt;br/&gt;[20:26] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Not a problem :)&lt;br/&gt;[20:26] &lt;amurray&gt; ok (fyi the packageset is quite long https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/jbYsvvfVgq/ so I assume the kubuntu folks might want to scope their statement of support a bit)&lt;br/&gt;[20:26] &lt;rbasak&gt; I think a flavour packageset is a poor list to use outside of DMB managed ACLs because they are (were) automatically produced&lt;br/&gt;[20:26] &lt;vorlon&gt; https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/packagesets/noble/kubuntu btw&lt;br/&gt;[20:27] &lt;rbasak&gt; ...and they might change arbitrarily for the same sort of reason in the future&lt;br/&gt;[20:27] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; I'll follow up on our end to see if Rik had a particular rhyme or reason.&lt;br/&gt;[20:27] &lt;amurray&gt; ok, we'll continue this via email then&lt;br/&gt;[20:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; rbasak: unfortunately it's the best proxy we have for "things in this flavor that aren't also in a base seed" without additional coding that we've never bothered doing.  But I agree&lt;br/&gt;[20:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; tsimonq2: I look forward to you elaborating on your support plan for cvs&lt;br/&gt;[20:28] &lt;rbasak&gt; The task of fixing the scripts is years old and not taken now. The DMB currently just adjusts them manually on request.&lt;br/&gt;[20:28] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; vorlon: lol :)&lt;br/&gt;[20:28] &lt;rbasak&gt; So there's no longer really any assurance that packages in there aren't in a different seed. Nobody is checking for that.&lt;br/&gt;[20:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; uh you can give me an action to look whether we have any ubuntu-archive / ubuntu-release bits that would let me say "this bit is the flavor-specific overlay"&lt;br/&gt;[20:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; because what we want to see is set(kubuntu-seeds) - set(platform-seeds)&lt;br/&gt;[20:29] &lt;amurray&gt; #action vorlon to look into scripting for packages in flavor-specific overlays&lt;br/&gt;[20:29] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: vorlon to look into scripting for packages in flavor-specific overlays&lt;br/&gt;[20:30] &lt;amurray&gt; ACTION: vorlon to confirm ratification of Lubuntu LTS&lt;br/&gt;[20:30] &lt;amurray&gt; as noted above, this was already done&lt;br/&gt;[20:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; well. set(kubuntu-seeds) - set(platform-seeds) - set(ubuntu-seeds)&lt;br/&gt;[20:31] &lt;amurray&gt; #topic Scan the mailing list archive for anything we missed (standing item)&lt;br/&gt;[20:31] &lt;rbasak&gt; xnox asked for a change in LP&lt;br/&gt;[20:31] &lt;vorlon&gt; yes&lt;br/&gt;[20:32] &lt;vorlon&gt; which he pointed out that my previous request for apt maintainer sign-off was unfortunately on a superseded mp and thus "lost" to the stream&lt;br/&gt;[20:32] &lt;vorlon&gt; with my AA hat on I have 0 concerns about dropping this if apt itself doesn't use it&lt;br/&gt;[20:32] &lt;rbasak&gt; I wanted to know who would be taking responsibility for the change, dealing with any fallout, etc, and I don't think I got a clear answer to that.&lt;br/&gt;[20:32] &lt;amurray&gt; yep - I'm not sure how to proceed here - there is clearly some perceived risk in this change but its not clear to me who owns it&lt;br/&gt;[20:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; I will as an AA&lt;br/&gt;[20:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; give this to me as an action please&lt;br/&gt;[20:33] &lt;rbasak&gt; Great - thanks!&lt;br/&gt;[20:33] &lt;amurray&gt; thanks vorlon&lt;br/&gt;[20:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; (TBH I think despite the acl being owned by the TB this could have just been handled directly with the AA members of the TB rather than involving the TB as a whole)&lt;br/&gt;[20:33] &lt;amurray&gt; #action vorlon to follow up on xnox's request to set noble.publish_i18n_index to False&lt;br/&gt;[20:33] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: vorlon to follow up on xnox's request to set noble.publish_i18n_index to False&lt;br/&gt;[20:34] &lt;amurray&gt; I don't see anything else on the mailing list for today&lt;br/&gt;[20:34] &lt;amurray&gt; #topic Check up on community bugs and techboard bugs&lt;br/&gt;[20:34] &lt;amurray&gt; #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-community/+bugs?field.assignee=techboard&lt;br/&gt;[20:34] &lt;amurray&gt; #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/techboard&lt;br/&gt;[20:35] &lt;amurray&gt; nothing here either&lt;br/&gt;[20:35] &lt;amurray&gt; #topic Select a chair for the next meeting (next from https://launchpad.net/~techboard/+members)&lt;br/&gt;[20:35] &lt;amurray&gt; looks like its me and rbasak as backup&lt;br/&gt;[20:35] &lt;rbasak&gt; ack&lt;br/&gt;[20:35] &lt;amurray&gt; #agreed next meeting chair: amurray, backup: rbasak&lt;br/&gt;[20:35] &lt;meetingology&gt; AGREED: next meeting chair: amurray, backup: rbasak&lt;br/&gt;[20:36] &lt;amurray&gt; #topic AOB&lt;br/&gt;[20:36] &lt;rbasak&gt; o/&lt;br/&gt;[20:36] &lt;vorlon&gt; the covention is that it be sil2100 with rbasak as backup, but ok :)&lt;br/&gt;[20:36] &lt;vorlon&gt; +n&lt;br/&gt;[20:36] &lt;amurray&gt; oh cool&lt;br/&gt;[20:36] &lt;amurray&gt; #agreed next meeting chair: sil2100, backup: rbasak&lt;br/&gt;[20:36] &lt;meetingology&gt; AGREED: next meeting chair: sil2100, backup: rbasak&lt;br/&gt;[20:36] &lt;vorlon&gt; (i.e. missing your chair spot doesn't get you off the hook for chairing :)&lt;br/&gt;[20:37] &lt;amurray&gt; does anyone else have AOB? otherwise rbasak the floor is yours&lt;br/&gt;[20:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; This relates to "snap-MIRs" here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1apUKR4gtOrfPGCWmtoebaQUhoy-fG8Cyo3VKJyhnpD0/edit#heading=h.whx7oqqnxsv0&lt;br/&gt;[20:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; Our previous discussions are summarised and linked from there. This is the only thing that might be holding up the main body text. To make progress I'd like to: 1) decide if it really needs to be general, because if we can agree that it's snap-specific then we can progress on the main body at least; 2) meet in a higher bandwidth medium (Google Meet?) with amurray and maybe seb128, sil2100, whoever&lt;br/&gt;[20:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; else wants to be involved to actually get something drafted that works for us.&lt;br/&gt;[20:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; This might be homework for you for next time to remind yourself of the previous conversation, but maybe it's worth mentioning here in public that I'd like to resolve this out-of-band and come back with a result to present in public in order to get something into the draft that's workable for everyone. I'd still expect a final vote / ratification here in public regardless so I don't think there need&lt;br/&gt;[20:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; be any concerns about not being public enough with the work on this.&lt;br/&gt;[20:38] &lt;amurray&gt; sounds reasonable to me&lt;br/&gt;[20:38] &lt;vorlon&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[20:39] &lt;rbasak&gt; Thanks. I'll set up a meeting then. Anybody else who'd like to be involved, please contact me.&lt;br/&gt;[20:40] &lt;amurray&gt; we already have an action item on the agenda around this so I won't add any additional one&lt;br/&gt;[20:40] &lt;seb128&gt; rbasak, I had that action item but I'm happy for it to grab it if you have time to move that forward&lt;br/&gt;[20:41] &lt;rbasak&gt; seb128: I think that was on a different point - snap tracks?&lt;br/&gt;[20:41] &lt;amurray&gt; yeah we have 2 similar items on the agenda - one is about track usage and the other is about test plans for third-party apps - this is about the second one&lt;br/&gt;[20:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; We could try and combine them to make scheduling easier&lt;br/&gt;[20:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; Approximately the same set of people need to discuss them anyway&lt;br/&gt;[20:42] &lt;amurray&gt; sure&lt;br/&gt;[20:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; So you can leave it with me to schedule something&lt;br/&gt;[20:42] &lt;amurray&gt; thanks rbasak&lt;br/&gt;[20:42] &lt;seb128&gt; ah, right, sorry ... but yeah, might be more efficient to cover both topics in one meeting&lt;br/&gt;[20:42] &lt;seb128&gt; rbasak, thanks!&lt;br/&gt;[20:43] &lt;amurray&gt; anything else for today...?&lt;br/&gt;[20:43] &lt;vorlon&gt; nothing here&lt;br/&gt;[20:43] &lt;rbasak&gt; Nothing else from me.

maybe we can have a public room on ubuntu matrix server&lt;br/&gt;[12:40] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; we should definitively use that&lt;br/&gt;[12:41] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I heard something being worked on by Mauro, or the intetion for it&lt;br/&gt;[12:41] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Rest I think discourse and mailing lists are fine..&lt;br/&gt;[12:41] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; do any of you know more about it?&lt;br/&gt;[12:41] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; youngbin: any idea?&lt;br/&gt;[12:41] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; how about the not official member of Ubuntu can access matrix?&lt;br/&gt;[12:41] &lt;youngbin&gt;  i would also like to ask should we keep rebooter group on telegram or ask people in that room to new matrix room later?&lt;br/&gt;[12:42] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; there was the intention to move I believe&lt;br/&gt;[12:42] &lt;mapreri&gt; totally pls keep telegram, until there are enough people on matrix, at least (I'm not yetâ¦ :( )&lt;br/&gt;[12:42] &lt;youngbin&gt; mIk3_08: you can join the room with non ubuntu.com account :)&lt;br/&gt;[12:42] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; we can bridge it maybe&lt;br/&gt;[12:42] &lt;youngbin&gt; mapreri: surely we can do things slowly&lt;br/&gt;[12:43] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; youngbin. Thanks&lt;br/&gt;[12:43] &lt;youngbin&gt; agreed we an setup bridge until all folks moved to matrix&lt;br/&gt;[12:43] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so lets follow up with Mauro, on that, and setup the bridge when we have the matrix channel&lt;br/&gt;[12:43] &lt;mapreri&gt; oh the topic of discourse, I think as council we should monitor ("watch") several boards - should we keep a list of somewhere of what all of us are supposed to monitor?&lt;br/&gt;[12:44] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes.. anyway since youngbin is active on matrix.. can have a quick chat anytime&lt;br/&gt;[12:44] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; mapreri: we should definitively, all those rellated with LoCo's&lt;br/&gt;[12:44] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; That is good idea mapreri.&lt;br/&gt;[12:44] &lt;mapreri&gt; like, apparently https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/locos/loco-support/156 + https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/locos/docs/130 + â¦ like the meeting agenda, that was posted in the mail board, but I don't want to subscribe that as it would notify for all suboards?&lt;br/&gt;[12:45] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Discourse.. keeping a list of pages is required I think for any loco team update tracking&lt;br/&gt;[12:45] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; maybe we can also do a regular report of LoCo activity, not just on discourse&lt;br/&gt;[12:45] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[12:45] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; keep an eye also on the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter&lt;br/&gt;[12:46] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[12:46] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[12:47] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so we can mabe open a pad every week and contribute to it&lt;br/&gt;[12:47] &lt;youngbin&gt; discourse have notification so maybe we can just subscribe to category. loco report activity on other places also sounds good&lt;br/&gt;[12:47] &lt;mapreri&gt; DiogoConstantino: mhh, activity of what are you talking about, sorry?&lt;br/&gt;[12:47] &lt;mapreri&gt; of each loco?&lt;br/&gt;[12:47] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I would say anything we find relevant&lt;br/&gt;[12:48] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; it doesn't need to be all&lt;br/&gt;[12:48] &lt;mapreri&gt; mh, I fear you are too optimist :)&lt;br/&gt;[12:48] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; just the things we find more interesting&lt;br/&gt;[12:48] &lt;youngbin&gt; btw are we on "Review the LoCo (re)validation procedure" topic?&lt;br/&gt;[12:48] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; something different that a LoCo is doing&lt;br/&gt;[12:48] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; youngbin: not yet&lt;br/&gt;[12:48] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; :-D mapreri&lt;br/&gt;[12:48] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; still on communication&lt;br/&gt;[12:48] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Like ubucon updates for instance..&lt;br/&gt;[12:49] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; or some new iniciative&lt;br/&gt;[12:49] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[12:49] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; an inovation&lt;br/&gt;[12:50] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so maybe we can come up with proposals for this&lt;br/&gt;[12:50] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; in writting&lt;br/&gt;[12:50] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; for next meeting&lt;br/&gt;[12:50] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; and we vote on it&lt;br/&gt;[12:50] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Would love to have a discussion on structuring of loco teams some day&lt;br/&gt;[12:50] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; do you agree?&lt;br/&gt;[12:50] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[12:50] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[12:51] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok&lt;br/&gt;[12:51] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so also still regarding communication&lt;br/&gt;[12:51] &lt;youngbin&gt; so we're going to collect loco activities on pad?&lt;br/&gt;[12:52] &lt;kanashiro&gt; sorry guys, I had a last minute concurrent meeting but I am reading the backlog&lt;br/&gt;[12:52] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; youngbin: the idea is to come up with a proposal on what to do about it&lt;br/&gt;[12:52] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; a vote on it next month&lt;br/&gt;[12:52] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I feel the concept needs to be developed&lt;br/&gt;[12:53] &lt;mapreri&gt; my take on that is that my loco really has no such wide/interesting activities that are worth reporting monthlyâ¦ even yearly.  We are basically mostly carrying on.&lt;br/&gt;[12:53] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; that's what we want to change&lt;br/&gt;[12:53] &lt;mapreri&gt; so asking for "reports" is imho both a "push to actually do more interesting stuff" and "damn they want me to do paperwork"&lt;br/&gt;[12:53] &lt;mapreri&gt; not sure what wins of the two&lt;br/&gt;[12:53] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Can we send proposals and ideas on mailing list or do you prefer elsewhere?&lt;br/&gt;[12:54] &lt;kanashiro&gt; which mailing list?&lt;br/&gt;[12:54] &lt;mapreri&gt; indeed, this should be flashed out elsewhere, not in this meeting&lt;br/&gt;[12:54] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; there's a LoCo council mailing list&lt;br/&gt;[12:54] &lt;youngbin&gt; so i understand the purpose is that we want to have some insights of what locos are doing?&lt;br/&gt;[12:54] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; but let's put them on discourse&lt;br/&gt;[12:54] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; :)&lt;br/&gt;[12:55] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; mapreri&lt;br/&gt;[12:55] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I'll create a topic on that&lt;br/&gt;[12:55] &lt;mapreri&gt; ty&lt;br/&gt;[12:55] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; and we can post it there&lt;br/&gt;[12:55] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Thanks&lt;br/&gt;[12:55] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; is it ok?&lt;br/&gt;[12:55] &lt;kanashiro&gt; I believe we first need to understand how healthy are the locos to then try to take any action to improve them, not sure if you guys have an idea about how locos are doing&lt;br/&gt;[12:55] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I have on some&lt;br/&gt;[12:55] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; not all&lt;br/&gt;[12:55] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; most are incipient at this point&lt;br/&gt;[12:56] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; and some are letargic&lt;br/&gt;[12:56] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; some are however very active&lt;br/&gt;[12:56] &lt;kanashiro&gt; sharing those things would be great for the new people like me :)&lt;br/&gt;[12:56] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; *are very&lt;br/&gt;[12:56] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Can we have a survey a general one covering the issues and pain points if any for a start?&lt;br/&gt;[12:56] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; that's a good idea&lt;br/&gt;[12:57] &lt;kanashiro&gt; that'd be a good start IMO&lt;br/&gt;[12:57] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[12:57] &lt;youngbin&gt; yup soduns like good idea :)&lt;br/&gt;[12:57] &lt;youngbin&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[12:57] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[12:57] &lt;kanashiro&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[12:57] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok we shall prepare one&lt;br/&gt;[12:57] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes&lt;br/&gt;[12:58] &lt;mapreri&gt; that's likely point 5 of this meeting? kindaâ¦&lt;br/&gt;[12:58] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; each of us come up with questions, and we can make a final version next month&lt;br/&gt;[12:58] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Seems good&lt;br/&gt;[12:58] &lt;youngbin&gt; sounds good. do we want to organize some action items before moving on?&lt;br/&gt;[12:58] &lt;mapreri&gt; but of course, I agree.&lt;br/&gt;[12:58] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; well lets just reorganize and go back to the topics&lt;br/&gt;[12:59] &lt;mapreri&gt; please.&lt;br/&gt;[12:59] &lt;youngbin&gt; ok&lt;br/&gt;[12:59] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; cool DiogoConstantino..&lt;br/&gt;[12:59] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; continuing on communication&lt;br/&gt;[12:59] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; how do we promote/communicate the idea of LoCos?&lt;br/&gt;[12:59] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; and where?&lt;br/&gt;[12:59] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; this is also part of our mission&lt;br/&gt;[13:00] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; can we maybe do an Ubuntu On Air session?&lt;br/&gt;[13:00] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Social media and in opensource conferences and on YouTube?&lt;br/&gt;[13:01] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1 for ubuntu on air&lt;br/&gt;[13:01] &lt;youngbin&gt; we can think about what loco do first. what loco usually do would be gathering folks interested in ubuntu and foss in their region&lt;br/&gt;[13:01] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; that's a good idea, there's a lot we alreay know&lt;br/&gt;[13:02] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; but maybe we don't know a lot&lt;br/&gt;[13:02] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I do know a bit about Europe&lt;br/&gt;[13:02] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Exactly&lt;br/&gt;[13:02] &lt;kanashiro&gt; at least for me (who is new to this subject in Ubuntu) it is hard to say when I do not understand well who we are trying to reach out exactly. That's why I mentioned that understanding the current state would help in any further action&lt;br/&gt;[13:02] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; also what Lina reported from Colombia&lt;br/&gt;[13:02] &lt;kanashiro&gt; but I understand you guys have more knowledge than me on this&lt;br/&gt;[13:02] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1 to kanashiro here&lt;br/&gt;[13:03] &lt;mapreri&gt; it seems that we are not ready to talk about promotion at all to me&lt;br/&gt;[13:03] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok&lt;br/&gt;[13:03] &lt;mapreri&gt; first step is listing out what we have (locos , then work from there.&lt;br/&gt;[13:03] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Lets develop from grassroots level first&lt;br/&gt;[13:03] &lt;mapreri&gt; first step is listing out what we have (locos + what they are doing right now), then work from there.&lt;br/&gt;[13:03] &lt;kanashiro&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[13:03] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok&lt;br/&gt;[13:03] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[13:03] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[13:03] &lt;mapreri&gt; about that&lt;br/&gt;[13:04] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; do tell&lt;br/&gt;[13:04] &lt;mapreri&gt; we have a loco-council@lists.ubuntu.com private mail list, which I believe nobody subscribed us to.  I'm sure we will eventually need that private thing.

the text after #vote is the "title" of what we are voting on&lt;br/&gt;[13:21] &lt;mapreri&gt; (and such text gets carried over to the minutes)&lt;br/&gt;[13:21] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ah ok&lt;br/&gt;[13:21] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; #topic Increasing visibility of the rebirth of the LoCo Council&lt;br/&gt;[13:22] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so do we need to do something about this, and how?&lt;br/&gt;[13:22] &lt;mapreri&gt; (so no "#vote +1" does not cast a vote; the "+1" needs to be the first chars of the line)&lt;br/&gt;[13:22] &lt;youngbin&gt; DiogoConstantino: so it's about promoting that we're back?&lt;br/&gt;[13:23] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; yes&lt;br/&gt;[13:23] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; For this we can do a team meeting and stream on Ubuntu on air maybe?&lt;br/&gt;[13:23] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Including the usual discourse social media and uwn&lt;br/&gt;[13:24] &lt;mapreri&gt; I think we could do such thing, pulling in LoCo leaders, etc, after having a list of such locosâ¦&lt;br/&gt;[13:24] &lt;youngbin&gt; AMA on UbuntuOnAir? discourse, social, blog, uwn also good way to promote&lt;br/&gt;[13:24] &lt;mapreri&gt; an AMA could be good.  with the loco leaders :P&lt;br/&gt;[13:24] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes&lt;br/&gt;[13:24] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; we can also use it to announce the survey&lt;br/&gt;[13:24] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes&lt;br/&gt;[13:25] &lt;youngbin&gt; yups agreed that we should reach out loco leaders first. im actually trying to reach out VN loco (since fossasia happening in Hanoi early April)&lt;br/&gt;[13:25] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so the idea is to do an AMA on Ubuntu On Air, and announce the survey?&lt;br/&gt;[13:26] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes&lt;br/&gt;[13:26] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok lets vote on it&lt;br/&gt;[13:26] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; #vote to do an AMA on Ubuntu On Air, and announce the survey?&lt;br/&gt;[13:26] &lt;meetingology&gt; Please vote on: to do an AMA on Ubuntu On Air, and announce the survey?&lt;br/&gt;[13:26] &lt;meetingology&gt;

#endvote&lt;br/&gt;[13:29] &lt;meetingology&gt; Voting ended on: to do an AMA on Ubuntu On Air, and announce the survey?&lt;br/&gt;[13:29] &lt;meetingology&gt; Votes for: 4, Votes against: 0, Abstentions: 0&lt;br/&gt;[13:29] &lt;meetingology&gt; Motion carried&lt;br/&gt;[13:29] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; next topic?&lt;br/&gt;[13:29] &lt;youngbin&gt; yups&lt;br/&gt;[13:29] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; #topic Identification of existing LoCoâs and prospective LoCoâs&lt;br/&gt;[13:30] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so this is pretty much what we also want to do with the survey, but the propective LoCo's is also in here&lt;br/&gt;[13:30] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; we also want to know what people need to take the next step&lt;br/&gt;[13:31] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; and become an official LoCo&lt;br/&gt;[13:31] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I feel it's slightly different&lt;br/&gt;[13:31] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; the issues might be different&lt;br/&gt;[13:31] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; and the help we can spare might also be different&lt;br/&gt;[13:31] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Survey and manual reachout will help here I guess.. as far as I remember there was a tool called locolint which checked the basics of active or inactive last time I was around&lt;br/&gt;[13:32] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; we should split this into two paths/groups of questions on the survey&lt;br/&gt;[13:32] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; coolbhavi: I never heard of that before&lt;br/&gt;[13:33] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; should be this? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoCouncil/LoCoLint&lt;br/&gt;[13:33] &lt;youngbin&gt; https://launchpad.net/locolint i think so...?&lt;br/&gt;[13:34] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; we can try to check it&lt;br/&gt;[13:34] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes&lt;br/&gt;[13:34] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; https://launchpad.net/locolint&lt;br/&gt;[13:34] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; but this is more for the (re)validation I believe&lt;br/&gt;[13:35] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; or ?&lt;br/&gt;[13:35] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes but more features can be added&lt;br/&gt;[13:36] &lt;mapreri&gt; I really don't think we need to be so analytical about the current LoCo tbh.&lt;br/&gt;[13:36] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so anyway we can use the Ubuntu On Air to appeal LoCo Leaders to contact us and prospective Loco teams as well&lt;br/&gt;[13:36] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; at FOSDEM, we tried to promote LoCo's so I expect something to come from that&lt;br/&gt;[13:37] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1 maperi as we are just restarting :)&lt;br/&gt;[13:37] &lt;youngbin&gt; agreed with mapreri. and what DiogoConstantino done at fosdem sounds good :)&lt;br/&gt;[13:38] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Same here&lt;br/&gt;[13:38] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so no specific action point besides the appeal on the stream, right?&lt;br/&gt;[13:38] &lt;youngbin&gt; me and coolbhavi plan to have booth on fossasia too we can also do LoCo promo there&lt;br/&gt;[13:38] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; nice&lt;br/&gt;[13:38] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes&lt;br/&gt;[13:39] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok lets move on to the next topic&lt;br/&gt;[13:39] &lt;mapreri&gt; i kind of envision just mailing all locos and ask you "do you exist?  what's your name?  what are you doing lately?"&lt;br/&gt;[13:39] &lt;mapreri&gt; and from there invite them for a chat in that call maybe.&lt;br/&gt;[13:39] &lt;youngbin&gt; mapreri: yup that would be also something we can try&lt;br/&gt;[13:40] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I don't think it would be a good fit for a stream, but a private call yes&lt;br/&gt;[13:40] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; with the LoCo Leaders&lt;br/&gt;[13:40] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1 kind of reminds me of the developer advisory team in 2013&lt;br/&gt;[13:40] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; kind of an office hour for the LoCo Leaders&lt;br/&gt;[13:41] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Exactly&lt;br/&gt;[13:41] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I like it because it will be complementary to the survey, we can include ont he survey a question regarding the usefullness and schedule for such thing&lt;br/&gt;[13:42] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; anything else?&lt;br/&gt;[13:42] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; That's what the developer advisory team was doing with the developers in the community back in 2012 reach out, survey, office hour and summary&lt;br/&gt;[13:43] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; as it appears there's nothing else on the topic&lt;br/&gt;[13:43] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; lets move on to the next&lt;br/&gt;[13:43] &lt;youngbin&gt; yups we can move on&lt;br/&gt;[13:43] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; #topic Identification of additional LoCo support structures&lt;br/&gt;[13:43] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so what I mean about this&lt;br/&gt;[13:44] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; is something like the Ubuntu Europe Federation&lt;br/&gt;[13:44] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; which is an association of European Ubuntu LoCo's&lt;br/&gt;[13:44] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; that tries to help Ubuntu LoCo's in similar ways to the LoCo Council, but also, by being a legal represation to sign contracts and such&lt;br/&gt;[13:45] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[13:45] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; some of the LoCo's are already associations&lt;br/&gt;[13:45] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; most are not&lt;br/&gt;[13:45] &lt;youngbin&gt; so kind of fiscal host and legal partner for locos?&lt;br/&gt;[13:45] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; yes&lt;br/&gt;[13:45] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; this is what the Ubuntu Europe Federation does&lt;br/&gt;[13:45] &lt;youngbin&gt; would need some more discussion. but agree that it would be useful :)&lt;br/&gt;[13:46] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; it's facilitated by the legal interoperabilidaty in Europe&lt;br/&gt;[13:46] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Need one for India too looking at the challenges of Ubucon Asia&lt;br/&gt;[13:46] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; coolbhavi: is the Free Software Foundation India not a thing?&lt;br/&gt;[13:46] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; maybe they would be willing&lt;br/&gt;[13:47] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; https://fsf.org.in/&lt;br/&gt;[13:47] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes but they have their own challenges&lt;br/&gt;[13:47] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Even SFI&lt;br/&gt;[13:47] &lt;youngbin&gt; I remember India LoCo actually using FOSSUnited for UbuCon Asia but seems like it has some limitation due to regulation.&lt;br/&gt;[13:47] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes&lt;br/&gt;[13:48] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so there's nothing like Ubuntu Europe elsewhere...&lt;br/&gt;[13:49] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; None that I am aware of&lt;br/&gt;[13:49] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I can see how the EU makes it easier&lt;br/&gt;[13:49] &lt;mapreri&gt; indeed&lt;br/&gt;[13:49] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; well let's keep this in mind, and if ideas on how to overcome this come, take note and mention them on the meetings&lt;br/&gt;[13:49] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes being a permanent resident in the EU I can see a lot of advantages&lt;br/&gt;[13:49] &lt;mapreri&gt; remember that many countries have plenty of capital controls in place that makes moving money in/out of them annoying, so something similar to Ubuntu EU is hard to recreate cross-countries in other areas of the world.&lt;br/&gt;[13:50] &lt;youngbin&gt; I agree with the idea basically. but some loco might have some limitation with access due to local regulation.&lt;br/&gt;[13:50] &lt;youngbin&gt; agreed with mapreri&lt;br/&gt;[13:50] &lt;youngbin&gt; maybe we can do some research first?&lt;br/&gt;[13:50] &lt;mapreri&gt; or not recognizing particular entities from other countries (when talking about signing stuff, etc)&lt;br/&gt;[13:50] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; youngbin: we should&lt;br/&gt;[13:50] &lt;mapreri&gt; but for EU, that's great and useful once it running full steam indeed!&lt;br/&gt;[13:51] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1 there is a ton of difference I can see and we should do some research&lt;br/&gt;[13:51] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; in the EU it exits, but it's not operational in practice&lt;br/&gt;[13:51] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; From the eu to India I have experience&lt;br/&gt;[13:52] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok lets research and come back to it when we have something&lt;br/&gt;[13:52] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; next topic:&lt;br/&gt;[13:52] &lt;youngbin&gt; sounds good&lt;br/&gt;[13:52] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; I am interested&lt;br/&gt;[13:52] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; #topic LoCo outreach&lt;br/&gt;[13:53] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; we have already talked about it a bit, but is there something you want to add?&lt;br/&gt;[13:53] &lt;youngbin&gt; well i added this topic but seems like we have already discussed on previous topics&lt;br/&gt;[13:53] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Lets start with survey for the outreach and take it step by step&lt;br/&gt;[13:53] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok&lt;br/&gt;[13:54] &lt;mapreri&gt; yep&lt;br/&gt;[13:54] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so now it's time for coolbhavi to report on the Indian Loco?&lt;br/&gt;[13:54] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes.. we are hosting ubucon Asia this year in Jaipur India&lt;br/&gt;[13:54] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; #topic coolbhavi to report on the Indian Loco&lt;br/&gt;[13:55] &lt;youngbin&gt; so seems like it's part of AOB :)&lt;br/&gt;[13:55] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; how's that comming along?&lt;br/&gt;[13:55] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; And the team is working on negotiating the venue now&lt;br/&gt;[13:55] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; is there something we can do to help?&lt;br/&gt;[13:55] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; This years ubucon Asia is on aug 31 to September 2&lt;br/&gt;[13:56] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; now, or something you predict for the next few months?&lt;br/&gt;[13:56] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Will reach out incase help is required in the coming months&lt;br/&gt;[13:57] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok&lt;br/&gt;[13:57] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Right now we are working on logistics and it has its own challenges in the regulations in India&lt;br/&gt;[13:57] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; is there something that surprised you?&lt;br/&gt;[13:58] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; maybe it will surprise any other Ubucon organizer elsewhere&lt;br/&gt;[13:58] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Actually we planned for a joint event with gnome asia and that is also under discussion&lt;br/&gt;[13:58] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; nice&lt;br/&gt;[13:59] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; No surprises till now as we expected challenges due to regulations&lt;br/&gt;[13:59] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; And we are working around it&lt;br/&gt;[13:59] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I and a few people from Debian are planning to try DebConf 26 in Portugal, and if we can we also try Ubucon Europe here the days before&lt;br/&gt;[14:00] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Only surprise is the venue asking for 50 percent of ticket sales as venue fees&lt;br/&gt;[14:00] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; So we are negotiating&lt;br/&gt;[14:00] &lt;youngbin&gt; coolbhavi: many thanks for the work :) looking forward to see UbuCon Asia happening in Jaipur&lt;br/&gt;[14:00] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; yes&lt;br/&gt;[14:01] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; keep it up&lt;br/&gt;[14:01] &lt;youngbin&gt; coolbhavi: So the fee rate is depending on ticket pricing?&lt;br/&gt;[14:01] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Welcome and yes we are excited too&lt;br/&gt;[14:01] &lt;youngbin&gt; i think i will be also busy with organizing events: UbuCon Asia, UbuCon KR, DebConf24 so many lol&lt;br/&gt;[14:02] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; yes&lt;br/&gt;[14:02] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; those are a lot&lt;br/&gt;[14:02] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I have less&lt;br/&gt;[14:02] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; youngbin: they are not bothered about the fee rate they need 50 percent of whatever ticket sales&lt;br/&gt;[14:02] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; UbunCon Portugal which will be during the Free Software Festival, and I'm part of the orga for both&lt;br/&gt;[14:02] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Which I have a meeting on Monday&lt;br/&gt;[14:02] &lt;youngbin&gt; :+1&lt;br/&gt;[14:03] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; As exams are still going on in parts of the country&lt;br/&gt;[14:03] &lt;mapreri&gt; coolbhavi: ticket 0$, just ask for donations :P&lt;br/&gt;[14:03] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ;P&lt;br/&gt;[14:03] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; That's my worst case scenario&lt;br/&gt;[14:04] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Haha&lt;br/&gt;[14:04] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; we only charged for the first Ubucon Europe&lt;br/&gt;[14:04] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; but we got meals for free&lt;br/&gt;[14:04] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; in return&lt;br/&gt;[14:04] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; all others where gratis&lt;br/&gt;[14:05] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Hmm good point will negotiate and come up with more details next meeting&lt;br/&gt;[14:05] &lt;mapreri&gt; personally I'll need to go in ~15 mins, FYI&lt;br/&gt;[14:05] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I also&lt;br/&gt;[14:05] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so lets end here&lt;br/&gt;[14:05] &lt;youngbin&gt; same&lt;br/&gt;[14:05] &lt;coolbhavi&gt;

if you happen to be providing the 1245676th package of the gnome stack&lt;br/&gt;[15:48] &lt;eslerm&gt; recently, the apparmor team has begun needing to write profiles (there is a new mandate) and it would be nice if owning or development teams owned that&lt;br/&gt;[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; then you can't be expected to be the one that makes all gnome isolated&lt;br/&gt;[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; for example&lt;br/&gt;[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I've seen the updates on jira about adding apparmor&lt;br/&gt;[15:48] &lt;eslerm&gt; that type of wording works&lt;br/&gt;[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and I smiled as - like I said - we do that almost every cycle for a while&lt;br/&gt;[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but we had cases where you just can not predict the millions of ways something is used&lt;br/&gt;[15:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; so very true&lt;br/&gt;[15:49] &lt;eslerm&gt; I believe apparmor folks would be responsible to review, it would be reasonable&lt;br/&gt;[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; with a wording that is not too allowing but leaving a door open I'm ok&lt;br/&gt;[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; will you or the apparmor folks provide a PR on how they think&lt;br/&gt;[15:49] &lt;eslerm&gt; can do&lt;br/&gt;[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we can then discuss until we reach a wording we believe that works&lt;br/&gt;[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and the first few passing that will then tell us how possible or impossible that is&lt;br/&gt;[15:49] &lt;eslerm&gt; I wanted to start the discussion, and work on this mostly for 24.10&lt;br/&gt;[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt;

CPC has a packageset (ubuntu-cloud; cf: https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/packagesets/noble/ubuntu-cloud). We'd like to revive it and the first step would be to polish it a bit. Would it be okay to drop some packages from the package and add some new via the usual process (mail devel-permissions@ with the updated list and collect&lt;br/&gt;[16:05] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; +1s, et al). Would anyone have an objection?&lt;br/&gt;[16:05] &lt;sil2100&gt; I don't see why not, we can vote on the actual packageset changes via ML as usual&lt;br/&gt;[16:05] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I don't think it is necessary to review removals.&lt;br/&gt;[16:05] &lt;rbasak&gt; As long as the changes match the defined packageset description "Packages required to create, bootstrap, use or configure Ubuntu Cloud images and their derivatives" then we only require one DMB member to approve.&lt;br/&gt;[16:05] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Only additions.&lt;br/&gt;[16:05] &lt;rbasak&gt; Though please keep the record on the ML&lt;br/&gt;[16:06] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; of course&lt;br/&gt;[16:07] &lt;bdmurray&gt; o/ one topic&lt;br/&gt;[16:07] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; perfect, since there are no objections, I'll come back with the new set in some time on the list.&lt;br/&gt;[16:07] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; yes, please&lt;br/&gt;[16:07] &lt;bdmurray&gt; me?&lt;br/&gt;[16:08] &lt;bdmurray&gt; We need to run an election in the next couple of months.

yes&lt;br/&gt;[16:21] &lt;vorlon&gt; flavors that are staying on ubiquity should have direct commit/upload control without being gated by Core Dev or Foundations&lt;br/&gt;[16:21] &lt;vorlon&gt; and we should do the work for the one-time split, instead of the ongoing work of having to sponsor uploads :)&lt;br/&gt;[16:22] &lt;juliank&gt;

vorlon: Well tomorrow is glibc upload&lt;br/&gt;[16:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; adrien: the card for libxcrypt vs ruby3.1 is marked done but it shows as still blocked?&lt;br/&gt;[16:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; by autopkgtest&lt;br/&gt;[16:28] &lt;juliank&gt; But yes glibc is huge :)&lt;br/&gt;[16:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; uh hang on update_excuses shows libxcrypt blocked by a lot more stuff than what's listed on the by-team report&lt;br/&gt;[16:29] &lt;vorlon&gt;

I should also refresh update_excuses in my browser when comparing&lt;br/&gt;[16:29] &lt;adrien&gt; vorlon: it's done, I'll update the card&lt;br/&gt;[16:29] &lt;juliank&gt; :)&lt;br/&gt;[16:30] &lt;adrien&gt; or at least look at why it shows up&lt;br/&gt;[16:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; adrien: my point is the card already says it's done and there's still a failing autopkgtest on armhf&lt;br/&gt;[16:30] &lt;vorlon&gt;

The chair is lucyllewy.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology&lt;br/&gt;[20:02] &lt;meetingology&gt; Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick&lt;br/&gt;[20:02] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; #chair lucyllewy&lt;br/&gt;[20:02] &lt;meetingology&gt; Current chairs: lucyllewy&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 1st February 2024. The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...&lt;br/&gt;[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; We only have one applicant today, Jason Nucciaarone&lt;br/&gt;[20:04] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; Hello everyone o/&lt;br/&gt;[20:04] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; @nuccitheboss can you please introduce yourself to the board and share your launchpad and application links&lt;br/&gt;[20:04] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; Yes yes&lt;br/&gt;[20:04] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; I'll share the links first and then write my bio&lt;br/&gt;[20:05] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; Application link: https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/jason-c-nucciarone-membership-application/41501/1&lt;br/&gt;[20:05] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/~nuccitheboss&lt;br/&gt;[20:05] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; GitHub: https://github.com/NucciTheBoss&lt;br/&gt;[20:06] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; HPC community team: https://ubuntu.com/community/governance/teams/hpc&lt;br/&gt;[20:06] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; Okay - time for intro&lt;br/&gt;[20:10] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; My name is Jason C. Nucciarone and I am an HPC engineer at Canonical, and a "Not so Ancient Elder" of the Ubuntu HPC community. Outside my primary duties at Canonical, I like to work with all things community. I started the HPC community team with several folks in the Ubuntu community to work on "Charmed HPC," which is a supercomputing stack that we are developing for Ubuntu. I am dedicated to this project because I want&lt;br/&gt;[20:10] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; to see Ubuntu more represented in the HPC ecosystem and be a viable alternative to the RHELatives. I do all sorts of things HPC, such as working with Simon, Aaron, and Mauro to organise Ubuntu-related conference, and I submit to lots of conference to speak about using Ubuntu for supercomputing&lt;br/&gt;[20:11] &lt;Kilos&gt; ty&lt;br/&gt;[20:12] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; ok. I'll let the board peruse those links and post and questions with the first question, which is mandatory:&lt;br/&gt;[20:12] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; You have signed the Code of Conduct. Do you affirm that you have read and understood the whole document, and do you agree to be bound by the terms for the duration of your membership should it be granted?&lt;br/&gt;[20:12] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; Yes!&lt;br/&gt;[20:12] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; awesome. thank you for confirming.

(I've had one or two OOB uploads approved by AAs in edge cases though as a coredev)&lt;br/&gt;[17:10] &lt;teward&gt; but ye it's outside the standard scope&lt;br/&gt;[17:11]  * schopin actually looks at the proposed changes&lt;br/&gt;[17:12] &lt;teward&gt; see this is the thing that makes me pause here&lt;br/&gt;[17:12] &lt;teward&gt; "`google-guest-agent` is a package provided by Google for installation within guests that run on Google Compute Engine (GCE)"&lt;br/&gt;[17:13] &lt;teward&gt; GCE shouldn't be offering those older images still&lt;br/&gt;[17:13] &lt;teward&gt; if they are they're doing something odd/stupid&lt;br/&gt;[17:13] &lt;teward&gt; or rather, they shouldn't offer those images for *NEW* installs IMO&lt;br/&gt;[17:14] &lt;teward&gt; if they simply... disable Xenial / Bionic image selection... that kind of solves the issue already no?&lt;br/&gt;[17:15] &lt;schopin&gt; I'm not much of a cloud person, are dist-upgrades not a thing in that domain?&lt;br/&gt;[17:16] &lt;teward&gt; last i checked GCE behaved like AWS EC2 instances or VPSes, and can dist-upgrade.  I'm not *google* but if this package is provided **for installation within guests** and does something that enables GCE stuff in the VM environment (similar to open-vm-tools for VMware for example), then it would be part of the image on-install&lt;br/&gt;[17:17] &lt;teward&gt; and if the older images are *gone* then the issue is irrelevant since new installs can't be run for those releases&lt;br/&gt;[17:17] &lt;teward&gt; and anything having the image already would already have everything&lt;br/&gt;[17:17] &lt;teward&gt; my 2 cents and cursory untested unvetted thoughts&lt;br/&gt;[17:17] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm not familiar with their offering but I am aware that you can get instances from cloud vendors that have Ubuntu Pro included, and therefore I infer that it makes sense for cloud vendors to continue offering those instance types until EOL.&lt;br/&gt;[17:17] &lt;teward&gt; rbasak: by EOL do you mean Pro EOL or overall EOL/&lt;br/&gt;[17:18] &lt;teward&gt; and in which case if Pro is enabled shouldn't this be distributed via ESM / Pro and not standard SRU&lt;br/&gt;[17:18] &lt;rbasak&gt; End of Standard Support = 5 years; End of Life = 10 years or whatever Pro ends up being by then.&lt;br/&gt;[17:18] &lt;schopin&gt; Well yes, that's why I directed them to Security (because in my mind Pro updates -&gt; Security)&lt;br/&gt;[17:19] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm not sure if the agent needs to be special via SRU. We do push the Pro Client via SRU as an exception (details and rationale documented at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuAdvantageToolsUpdates)&lt;br/&gt;[17:20] &lt;rbasak&gt; Looking at the bug, sounds like the plan is to put it in via ESM, and it's just a matter of managing the bug tasks appropriately?&lt;br/&gt;=== arif-ali_ is now known as arif-ali&lt;br/&gt;=== arraybolt3_wc is now known as arraybolt3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;# UBUNTU-MEETING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=== mIk3_09 is now known as mIk3_08&lt;br/&gt;=== arraybolt3_wc is now known as arraybolt3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">31.01.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>30.01.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</title><description># UBUNTU-SECURITY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=== JanC is now known as Guest5945&lt;br/&gt;=== JanC_ is now known as JanC&lt;br/&gt;=== cpaelzer_ is now known as cpaelzer&lt;br/&gt;=== arraybolt3 is now known as arraybolt3_wc&lt;br/&gt;=== shettysudhird is now known as sshetty&lt;br/&gt;=== arraybolt3_wc is now known as arraybolt3&lt;br/&gt;=== shettysudhird is now known as sshetty&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;# UBUNTU-MEETING&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;=== JanC_ is now known as JanC&lt;br/&gt;[15:20] &lt;didrocks&gt; hey MIR team, as usual, not available but will read the backlog later.

no&lt;br/&gt;[15:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, then here the FYI&lt;br/&gt;[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; there is effort in making the default set of tools available for performance and crash analysis nicer to the users&lt;br/&gt;[15:44] &lt;sarnold&gt; nice&lt;br/&gt;[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; details vary and depend on the context, no need to go into too much details - if you are curious get in touch&lt;br/&gt;[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but what is worth&lt;br/&gt;[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; is that out of that effort there will be an expected flurry of MIRs and associated security reviews coming&lt;br/&gt;[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the amount is probably 3-8&lt;br/&gt;[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so not too insane&lt;br/&gt;[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but it will be noble time-frame&lt;br/&gt;[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so to whatever amount you can, reserve some time and tell your managers upfront&lt;br/&gt;[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; involved are mostly kernel, foundations and server - but to some extend anyone that feels to belong to *ubuntu*&lt;br/&gt;[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so much for now I'd think&lt;br/&gt;[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I think the MIR review capactity is fine for this&lt;br/&gt;[15:46] &lt;eslerm&gt; knowning which packages to plan for would help&lt;br/&gt;[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; for security we thought this is worth to be mentioned to know about it by now instead of out of a sudden&lt;br/&gt;[15:46] &lt;eslerm&gt; it is appreciated :)&lt;br/&gt;[15:47] &lt;sarnold&gt; in yesterday's team meeting I communicated that there's usually a flurry of last-minute packages to review&lt;br/&gt;[15:47] &lt;sarnold&gt; so hopefully our need for more reviewers won't come as a surprise&lt;br/&gt;[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt;

Though as above I've been looking at one, might as well carry it over until discussed since it's unlikely to be resolved completely today.&lt;br/&gt;[20:04] &lt;amurray&gt; sounds good to me (mine are all carry-over)&lt;br/&gt;[20:04] &lt;seb128&gt; ACTION: seb128 to follow-up with ubuntu cinnamon on 24.04 request  -&gt; https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2024-January/002853.html&lt;br/&gt;[20:04] &lt;seb128&gt; no reply from them though&lt;br/&gt;[20:04] &lt;seb128&gt; ACTION: seb128 to follow-up with ubuntu budgie on 24.04 request  -&gt; https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2024-January/002855.html&lt;br/&gt;[20:05] &lt;vorlon&gt; seb128: thanks&lt;br/&gt;[20:05] &lt;seb128&gt; and we had 4 +1 votes so I think that's approved&lt;br/&gt;[20:05] &lt;vorlon&gt; agreed&lt;br/&gt;[20:05] &lt;vorlon&gt; mine is also carry-over&lt;br/&gt;[20:05] &lt;vorlon&gt; seb128: do you want to send a follow-up email to confirm this is approved?&lt;br/&gt;[20:05] &lt;vorlon&gt; (amurray had an action to do so for UbuntuKylin)&lt;br/&gt;[20:06] &lt;amurray&gt; yeah not sure how I missed that but will get to it later today&lt;br/&gt;[20:06] &lt;seb128&gt; vorlon, yes, I will send the budgie email&lt;br/&gt;[20:07] &lt;vorlon&gt; #action seb128 to send confirmation of successful LTS status for UbuntuBudgie 24.04&lt;br/&gt;[20:07] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: seb128 to send confirmation of successful LTS status for UbuntuBudgie 24.04&lt;br/&gt;[20:07] &lt;vorlon&gt; #topic Scan the mailing list archive for anything we missed (standing item)&lt;br/&gt;[20:07] &lt;vorlon&gt; the various vote threads are accounted for, I think&lt;br/&gt;[20:07] &lt;vorlon&gt; two other threads on there we should probably touch base on&lt;br/&gt;[20:08] &lt;vorlon&gt; first is "VirtualBox Postmortem"&lt;br/&gt;[20:08] &lt;vorlon&gt; tsimonq2 let me know he wasn't available to attend this meeting today&lt;br/&gt;[20:08] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I'm here in his absence.&lt;br/&gt;[20:08] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (I did a bunch of the VirtualBox testing to solve the bug that email is related to.)&lt;br/&gt;[20:09] &lt;vorlon&gt; I have lots of thoughts in regards to that email, but perhaps someone who's not wearing dual TB + SRU hats wants to comment first&lt;br/&gt;[20:09] &lt;vorlon&gt; (which would be seb128 or amurray rather than rbasak or myself)&lt;br/&gt;[20:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; I do wear both hats, but my usual response in these cases is to ask for the responsible team to respond in the first instance.&lt;br/&gt;[20:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; In other words, even when TB escalation is appropriate, the TB should seek to get input from both sides - from both the complainant(s) and the responsible teams. In this case that'd be the SRU team, rather than non-SRU team members.&lt;br/&gt;[20:11] &lt;seb128&gt; right, I'm unsure if that's a topic for the TB at this point, I would like at least to see a reply from the SRU team first&lt;br/&gt;[20:11] &lt;vorlon&gt; well I'm going to say that the reason I haven't responded to this email at all yet is that I found it to be an entirely unconstructive and anti-collaborative approach to the question&lt;br/&gt;[20:11] &lt;seb128&gt; rbasak, vorlon, do you have any insight if the SRU team is working on a reply?&lt;br/&gt;[20:11] &lt;amurray&gt; from my point of view, whilst I can entirely understand the frustrations expressed in the email, I also can sympathise with the SRU team et al - due to the distributed / silo'd nature of Ubuntu development this kind of thing feels sometimes inevitable even when we try hard to coordinate to avoid such situations&lt;br/&gt;[20:12] &lt;amurray&gt; so unless a response from the SRU team highlights any particular problems on their side, I am not sure there is much for the TB to do at this time&lt;br/&gt;[20:12] &lt;vorlon&gt; I'm not aware of a current SRU team decision about responding to the email&lt;br/&gt;[20:12] &lt;rbasak&gt; The SRU team haven't had an opportunity to discuss this yet really.&lt;br/&gt;[20:13] &lt;rbasak&gt; The relevant people to discuss this are in a late-ish timezone, and we usually chat every four weeks, and that hasn't come up yet.&lt;br/&gt;[20:14] &lt;rbasak&gt; I don't mind going into more details now, on behalf of the SRU team, and while vorlon's also here. But maybe that's not really appropriate right now (or do others think otherwise?)&lt;br/&gt;[20:14] &lt;seb128&gt; is that going to happen before the next TB meeting then? if so maybe let's revisit next time?&lt;br/&gt;[20:14] &lt;rbasak&gt; It might be if we were in a rush, but I have noticed SRU activity on this package, so is there still a rush?&lt;br/&gt;[20:14] &lt;vorlon&gt; should happen this week I think?&lt;br/&gt;[20:14] &lt;rbasak&gt; Yes - on Thursday - assuming the other relevant people are able to attend.&lt;br/&gt;[20:14] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; February 2, the new VBox SRU should be ready to go out. Me and LoB already did all verificaiton.&lt;br/&gt;[20:15] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; So I can confirm this week.&lt;br/&gt;[20:15] &lt;vorlon&gt; yes, SRU team meeting Thursday&lt;br/&gt;[20:15] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (assuming the SRU team does migrations from -proposed to -updates on Friday - I don't actually know if this is the case)&lt;br/&gt;[20:15] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'd like to be constructive here, but I'm finding that quite challenging.&lt;br/&gt;[20:15] &lt;rbasak&gt; A couple of things to note, if you're expecting the release to happen because you've marked verification-done...&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;seb128&gt; that's a long email with a lot of details, but to me it seems the SRU team should maybe add to their process to check if a kernel update breaks virtualbox&lt;br/&gt;[20:17] &lt;vorlon&gt; yes, a "post mortem" which assumes itself to be in possession of all of the facts without consulting &gt; half the people involved, and drawing conclusions and assigning blame, is not a springboard for a constructive discussion&lt;br/&gt;[20:17] &lt;vorlon&gt; seb128: that's the thing, I haven't had time to dig into this, but kernel SRUs are supposed to check the results of all dkms package builds&lt;br/&gt;[20:17] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I think with the virtualbox breakage bug, the issue was that the update was never accepted into proposed in the first place. There was nothing any other team could have done.&lt;br/&gt;[20:17] &lt;rbasak&gt; https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates#virtualbox is false. Contrary to what that says, I don't consider anything pre-approved by the SRU. I've mentioned this on IRC to LocutusOfBorg before.&lt;br/&gt;[20:17] &lt;rbasak&gt; by the SRU team&lt;br/&gt;[20:18] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I didn't read Simon's email as attempting to be a be-all-end-all postmortem, I thought it was intended to start discussion, laying out everything Simon knew already. His tone is rather negative, but I think he was trying to be constructive and that he had some good points if you read past the tone.&lt;br/&gt;[20:19] &lt;rbasak&gt; From what I consider to be the draft at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VirtualboxUpdates, it's not clear to me what precisely is committed to being verified, and even if it were, that hasn't been agreed by the SRU team. Therefore, there isn't a standard for me to confirm against that appopriate verification has been performed.&lt;br/&gt;[20:19] &lt;vorlon&gt; arraybolt3: telling the SRU team "you owe N an apology" is a pretty hard tone to get past.&lt;br/&gt;[20:19] &lt;rbasak&gt; In bug 2050891, currently the Test Plan says: "Install virtualbox, run VMs". That is not an acceptable test plan IMHO.&lt;br/&gt;[20:19] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Valid, I just am saying, don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.&lt;br/&gt;[20:19] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2050891 in virtualbox-hwe (Ubuntu Mantic) "[SRU] virtualbox 6.1.50 and 7.0.14" [Undecided, Fix Committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2050891&lt;br/&gt;[20:20] &lt;rbasak&gt; I believe this has all been raised before, and not addressed.&lt;br/&gt;[20:20] &lt;rbasak&gt; So from my perspective, were I asked to release it, the SRU is blocked.&lt;br/&gt;[20:20] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; rbasak: I think LocutusOfBorg simply put the test plan in the wrong spot.&lt;br/&gt;[20:20] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; To be fair, LoB told people in private chats that he was feeling ignored and got tired of pinging in #ubuntu-release since October that an SRU of virtualbox was ready for review. So, this was not a failure on his part.&lt;br/&gt;[20:20] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; It's right under "Where Problems Could Occur" under the "Some Guest OSes might fail to load" part.&lt;br/&gt;[20:21] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; Literally broke his spirit. That's no way to treat a community member.&lt;br/&gt;[20:21] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I can fix that right now if it's needed to unblock the SRU.&lt;br/&gt;[20:21] &lt;rbasak&gt; My frustration is that we iterated enough times already and it's still not acceptable to me. When I've been asked, I've tried to be helpful. I believe that conversation has already been linked to.&lt;br/&gt;[20:22] &lt;rbasak&gt; Let's be constructive please.&lt;br/&gt;[20:23] &lt;seb128&gt; I didn't found the detail by reading through the email again, but did anyone attempted to block promotion to updates of the kernel by flagging that it created a regression?&lt;br/&gt;[20:23] &lt;rbasak&gt; I hope it's quite clear that currently expectations are far from being met, and that this is the root cause of the issue.&lt;br/&gt;[20:23] &lt;seb128&gt; if not why did people do IRC pings instead of following the process?&lt;br/&gt;[20:23] &lt;rbasak&gt; So let's try to figure out how to get to a place where they are met, rather than throw accusations around.&lt;br/&gt;[20:23] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; seb128: tsimonq2 pinged xnox .&lt;br/&gt;[20:23] &lt;seb128&gt; xnox isn't an SRU team member&lt;br/&gt;[20:24] &lt;seb128&gt; and that wouldn't flag the SRU as not to promote on the SRU report&lt;br/&gt;[20:24] &lt;seb128&gt; anyway, I don't think we will resolve that tonight&lt;br/&gt;[20:24] &lt;seb128&gt; I would suggest we wait for the SRU team meeting this week and to see if there is an outcome of that discussion&lt;br/&gt;[20:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; true, but I think it's useful to have this frank discussion about some of the issues here, that as I mentioned was a bit blocked on the lists because long-form emails are something of a barrier&lt;br/&gt;[20:25] &lt;rbasak&gt; From my perspective, if someone says something is ready for review, I ask for substantial changes, they don't fix what I requested and then say it's ready for review again, so I ask for substantial changes, ad infinitum, at what point is it no longer reasonable to claim that I'm treating the uploader badly?&lt;br/&gt;[20:25] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; Another point: The SRU team meets *every four weeks?* Is this a time constraint issue, because, as someone with a leadership degree, this is not how teams are run under any circumstance. Furthermore, does the SRU team meet *behind closed doors*? That seems pretty suspicious to me.&lt;br/&gt;[20:26] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I'm fairly certain there's an SRU team meeting in this channel every four weeks?&lt;br/&gt;[20:26] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; rbasak: "I believe that conversation has already been linked to." I may be blind, but I don't see the link. (I'd just like to look over it so I can get a better understanding.)&lt;br/&gt;[20:26] &lt;vorlon&gt; I reject the characterization of this as "suspicious".  The SRU team is not a "leadership" team, it is a functional team with work to do and the meetings are internal to the team for getting things done&lt;br/&gt;[20:27] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; vorlon: A community team though, with community governance? I reject the notion that an open source team should be behind closed doors.&lt;br/&gt;[20:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; expecting teams to not have private meetings for working through outstanding task lists is unhelpful&lt;br/&gt;[20:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; I categorically reject this framing&lt;br/&gt;[20:28] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; I categorically disagree.&lt;br/&gt;[20:28] &lt;rbasak&gt; arraybolt3: it's in tsimonq2's email&lt;br/&gt;[20:28] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I'll have to agree with vorlon. We have a private Matrix Operators meeting every week in order to discuss difficult technical and management topics, we're an open-source and community-related team, and this is what is working best for us so far.&lt;br/&gt;[20:28] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; rbasak: thanks, I am blind then :P&lt;br/&gt;[20:29] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; arraybolt3: However, an SRU team isn't a team that has to deal with private matters regarding individuals.&lt;br/&gt;[20:29] &lt;rbasak&gt; arraybolt3: well, it is difficult. That's the issue with these threads that get longer and longer - they take expontentially more time to follow.&lt;br/&gt;[20:29] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; our meetings aren't about those either yet.&lt;br/&gt;[20:30] &lt;seb128&gt; rbasak, what I don't understand is that from that number of pings and the review of the virtualbox SRU how did we end up in a situation where nobody from the SRU team though we had a problem that needed to be resolved in some way before promoting the new kernel?&lt;br/&gt;[20:30] &lt;rbasak&gt; Pragmatically, we get stuff done quicker when the involved people can speak to each other high bandwidth without excessive bureaucracy&lt;br/&gt;[20:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; seb128: those kinds of technical details I think are something best worked through by the SRU team as we sort out responding to the email&lt;br/&gt;[20:30] &lt;rbasak&gt; seb128: I'm not aware that anybody flagged virtualbox as being broken by the new kernel.&lt;br/&gt;[20:31] &lt;rbasak&gt; At least, not to the SRU team.&lt;br/&gt;[20:31] &lt;rbasak&gt; Another complication is that the kernel SRU process operates fairly independently&lt;br/&gt;[20:31] &lt;seb128&gt; vorlon, ack&lt;br/&gt;[20:33] &lt;rbasak&gt; Eickmeyer: private matters regarding individuals&gt; I disagree. The complaints posted _are_ accusatory of the conduct of individuals.&lt;br/&gt;[20:34] &lt;vorlon&gt; independently of the rest of the SRU team, and also independently of the britney-triggered autopkgtests&lt;br/&gt;[20:34] &lt;rbasak&gt; There are various aspects of this matter that I am deliberately not going into here because it is inappropriate to discuss them publicly.&lt;br/&gt;[20:35] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; rbasak: Why is the SRU team discussing complaints of the conduct of individuals? That seems out of scope?&lt;br/&gt;[20:35]  * Eickmeyer is confused&lt;br/&gt;[20:35] &lt;rbasak&gt; I think it is in scope, but I cannot explain why exactly without going into private matters.&lt;br/&gt;[20:36] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'd be happy to explain to the TB in private, or to the CC in private.&lt;br/&gt;[20:36] &lt;rbasak&gt; But an escalation to the CC at this stage I think would be counterproductive. We need to stop being accusatory and try and resolve this constructively.&lt;br/&gt;[20:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok it's clear that the ball is in the SRU team's court for responding to the email, and I think we've exhausted any useful informal discussion here on the topic.  Moving on&lt;br/&gt;[20:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; #link https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2024-January/002862.html launchpad-buildd-admin team ownership&lt;br/&gt;[20:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; On that topic, Ubuntu's infrastructure provision arrangements from Canonical pre-date my involvement, but there's plenty of stuff that we rely very heavily on Canonical IS for, and I don't see any reason why this case needs to be an exception. So following the existing pattern, it makes sense to me to delegate management of this stuff to Canonical, just like various other infrastructure where we&lt;br/&gt;[20:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; already do that.&lt;br/&gt;[20:38] &lt;rbasak&gt; So +1 from me&lt;br/&gt;[20:38] &lt;vorlon&gt; wgrant had approached me privately about this earlier and I said I had no reservations but that it should be public&lt;br/&gt;[20:39] &lt;vorlon&gt; of anyone likely to be accidentally exercising this privilege, it would be those members of the Archive Admin team that *happen* to also be on the TB (me, sil2100, seb128)&lt;br/&gt;[20:39] &lt;vorlon&gt; and there's no reason for that to be the case&lt;br/&gt;[20:39] &lt;vorlon&gt; and if we need stuff as AAs we can work that out directly with launchpad instead&lt;br/&gt;[20:39] &lt;vorlon&gt; any objections?&lt;br/&gt;[20:39] &lt;amurray&gt; +1 from me too (although I can't help but notice that since all current TB members are Canonical employees I wonder if there is a perceived conflict of interest in being asked about this)&lt;br/&gt;[20:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; well. given that this is true it would still only be Canonical employees able to *exercise* that acl&lt;br/&gt;[20:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; and afaik none of us do&lt;br/&gt;[20:40] &lt;amurray&gt; indeed&lt;br/&gt;=== shettysudhird is now known as sshetty&lt;br/&gt;[20:41] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok 3 +1, I'll just follow up to the mail to confirm that as a TB position, thanks&lt;br/&gt;[20:41] &lt;amurray&gt; thanks vorlon&lt;br/&gt;[20:41] &lt;vorlon&gt; #action vorlon to confirm TB agreement to launchpad-buildd-admins ownership change&lt;br/&gt;[20:41] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: vorlon to confirm TB agreement to launchpad-buildd-admins ownership change&lt;br/&gt;[20:41] &lt;vorlon&gt; #topic Check up on community bugs and techboard bugs&lt;br/&gt;[20:42] &lt;vorlon&gt; #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-community/+bugs?field.assignee=techboard&lt;br/&gt;[20:42] &lt;vorlon&gt; zaroo boogs&lt;br/&gt;[20:42] &lt;vorlon&gt; #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/techboard&lt;br/&gt;[20:42] &lt;vorlon&gt; nothing new :/&lt;br/&gt;[20:42] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; Uh, what about Kubuntu requalification?&lt;br/&gt;[20:43] &lt;seb128&gt; sorry, I was catching up with other channels, I'm +1 also for the launchpad-buildd-admin&lt;br/&gt;[20:43] &lt;vorlon&gt; and there are carry-over actions for the two open bugs there&lt;br/&gt;[20:43] &lt;vorlon&gt; seb128: thanks&lt;br/&gt;[20:43] &lt;seb128&gt; Eickmeyer, I was going to ask about that in the AOB&lt;br/&gt;[20:43] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; seb128: Ah, thx&lt;br/&gt;[20:43] &lt;seb128&gt; it just arrived an hour ago&lt;br/&gt;[20:44] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok sorry I was assuming that the flavor qual stuff as a whole was in hand and failed to consider that the new mail should have a driver assigned to it&lt;br/&gt;[20:44] &lt;vorlon&gt; #topic Select a chair for the next meeting (next from https://launchpad.net/~techboard/+members)&lt;br/&gt;[20:44] &lt;vorlon&gt; I believe next should be sil2100 with amurray as backup&lt;br/&gt;[20:44] &lt;amurray&gt; ack&lt;br/&gt;[20:45] &lt;vorlon&gt; #agreed next chair: sil2100, backup: amurray&lt;br/&gt;[20:45] &lt;meetingology&gt; AGREED: next chair: sil2100, backup: amurray&lt;br/&gt;[20:45] &lt;vorlon&gt; #topic AOB&lt;br/&gt;[20:45] &lt;vorlon&gt; seb128:&lt;br/&gt;[20:45] &lt;seb128&gt; we missed https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2024-January/002864.html in the list review&lt;br/&gt;[20:45] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (not bringing it up right now, but I have a question related to Lubuntu LTS requalification at some point before AOB ends)&lt;br/&gt;[20:45] &lt;seb128&gt; we should have somone doing the review and call for a vote if it's ready&lt;br/&gt;[20:46] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; w.r.t. the Kubuntu LTS requalification, I see that Scarlett didn't list any official contacts.

ok, apt vs systemd. enr0n you uploaded systemd, do you want to follow up on this or do you want someone else to take it?&lt;br/&gt;[16:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; looks like there are a good number of autopkgtests needing sorted for systemd, not just apt&lt;br/&gt;[16:37] &lt;enr0n&gt; vorlon: I am working on another systemd upload (real failures in systemd's tests), so yes consider that with me&lt;br/&gt;[16:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok&lt;br/&gt;[16:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; enr0n: I assume systemd-hwe is similar, since it's your upload and it's your autopkgtests that are failing&lt;br/&gt;[16:38] &lt;enr0n&gt; vorlon: yes, systemd-hwe needs the new systemd&lt;br/&gt;[16:38] &lt;vorlon&gt; but doesn't declare a versioned dependency on it?&lt;br/&gt;[16:39] &lt;juliank&gt; heh I said the same thing but I don't remember wehre&lt;br/&gt;[16:39] &lt;vorlon&gt; (if it needs the new systemd at runtime and you declare a versioned dependency for this the autopkgtests would just dtrt I think; and also it would dtrt on the user's system...)&lt;br/&gt;[16:39] &lt;vorlon&gt; gnutls28, I'll take; just some autopkgtests to chase on ppc64el it looks like&lt;br/&gt;[16:39] &lt;schopin&gt; Wouldn't the autopkgtests just end up with all-proposed?&lt;br/&gt;[16:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; um and then the perl transition&lt;br/&gt;[16:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; so I'm not going to try to dig through here to find things to assign out&lt;br/&gt;[16:40] &lt;juliank&gt; heh&lt;br/&gt;[16:40] &lt;vorlon&gt;

I'd like someone to do a proper review of it - if someone already did it, I'm fine with voting&lt;br/&gt;[20:26] &lt;seb128&gt; no need to rush I would say&lt;br/&gt;[20:26] &lt;amurray&gt; no, his email is very detailed and covers everything I would have wanted to know&lt;br/&gt;[20:26] &lt;seb128&gt; you have an action item&lt;br/&gt;[20:26] &lt;seb128&gt; we can call for vote on the list once you have reviewed it&lt;br/&gt;[20:26] &lt;seb128&gt; no question from me either&lt;br/&gt;[20:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; Ok o/&lt;br/&gt;[20:27] &lt;seb128&gt; tsimonq2, no question it seems but thanks for taking the time to join the meeting in case we had some&lt;br/&gt;[20:27] &lt;seb128&gt; #topic Check up on community bugs and techboard bugs&lt;br/&gt;[20:27] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Hey, one more thing on this topic, briefly...&lt;br/&gt;[20:27] &lt;seb128&gt; tsimonq2, sure?&lt;br/&gt;[20:28] &lt;seb128&gt; (no activity on the community bugs and techboard bugs)&lt;br/&gt;[20:28] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Actually, two, sorry. I noted lack of cooperation generally speaking on that email, and I've seen a drastic change for the better. I still have some (genuine) questions around the SRU Team given recent events, but I'm planning a postmorteum on virtualbox anyway.&lt;br/&gt;[20:29] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Also, I appointed Aaron and Dan as assistant release managers, there's no direct action required from the TB, but a "hey we see this" would be great. :)&lt;br/&gt;[20:29] &lt;rbasak&gt; Well I asked and was told that no response was expected?&lt;br/&gt;[20:30] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Yes :) I'm glad you saw it, just making a general point to it.&lt;br/&gt;[20:30] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Anyway, those are the points I have, happy to answer any questions.&lt;br/&gt;[20:30] &lt;seb128&gt; I'm not aware the SRU team situation you are referencing to but it doesn't seem to be a TB topic at this point?&lt;br/&gt;[20:31] &lt;seb128&gt; aware of*&lt;br/&gt;[20:31] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm not sure either.&lt;br/&gt;[20:32] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; My general point is, asking for requalification is a two-way agreement. We are happy to provide support for Lubuntu, the only reason I brought it up is to ensure we have support on the other side to be able to move the needle forward.&lt;br/&gt;[20:32] &lt;seb128&gt; tsimonq2, and I've seen the email about the assistant release managers :-)&lt;br/&gt;[20:32] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; seb128: thanks :)&lt;br/&gt;[20:32] &lt;seb128&gt; ok, so seems there is no question/action there but thanks for mentioning those!&lt;br/&gt;[20:32] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Yes of course :)&lt;br/&gt;[20:32] &lt;seb128&gt; #topic Select a chair for the next meeting (next from https://launchpad.net/~techboard/+members)&lt;br/&gt;[20:33] &lt;rbasak&gt; I wonder if there's an opportunity to be talking more via the flavour syncs or something similar&lt;br/&gt;[20:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; I promise I'll be here in time for the next one so you can keep me as chair ;)&lt;br/&gt;[20:33] &lt;seb128&gt; next in the list is Steve and Lukasz as backup&lt;br/&gt;[20:33] &lt;rbasak&gt; Because I'm seeing noises, but without specifics, I'm not in a position to be able to help at all.&lt;br/&gt;[20:33] &lt;seb128&gt; vorlon, hey, and thanks!&lt;br/&gt;[20:35] &lt;seb128&gt; rbasak, yes, the flavor syncs is a good venue for project discussions with flavor&lt;br/&gt;[20:35] &lt;seb128&gt; flavors&lt;br/&gt;[20:35] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; As far as I'm aware, the TB has an open invite to the Flavor Syncs. If you talk to the Community Team (specifically ilvipero_), he should be able to get you an invite.&lt;br/&gt;[20:35] &lt;seb128&gt; #topic AOB&lt;br/&gt;[20:35] &lt;rbasak&gt; Please do arrange for the SRU team and/or TB to be invited if there's a specific agenda item you have in mind that you'd like to discuss&lt;br/&gt;[20:36] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Absolutely, just finishing with my notes on this one.

How would you check, technically, that you're not about to inadvertently trigger a large transition?&lt;br/&gt;[16:29] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Probably my first step is to look at the reverse depends with apt-cache rdepends.&lt;br/&gt;[16:29] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; after that, if there were some reverse depends, I check those reverse depends and so on.&lt;br/&gt;[16:29] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Usually shared libraries are at higher risk of causing these sorts of things than applications.&lt;br/&gt;[16:30] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (shared libraries including things like Python libraries, not necessarily libwhatever1 packages)&lt;br/&gt;[16:30] &lt;rbasak&gt; What would you be looking at in the rdepends list?&lt;br/&gt;[16:30] &lt;rbasak&gt; s/at/for/&lt;br/&gt;[16:30] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; mainly to see how big the network of rdepends is. One or two might not be a huge deal depending on what those one or two are...&lt;br/&gt;[16:31] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; ...but if there's a large network of them then I know to exercise caution and potentially not attempt the process at all.&lt;br/&gt;[16:31] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I could also check the update excuses page to see if packages that were rdepends were already part of transitions.&lt;br/&gt;[16:31] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Since entangling those could block other transitions and cause Big Problems.&lt;br/&gt;[16:31] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (the page I'm referring to is https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses.html)&lt;br/&gt;[16:32] &lt;rbasak&gt; Could you explain to me what you understand a transition to be exactly, please?&lt;br/&gt;[16:32]  * arraybolt3 opens the Proposed Migration page...&lt;br/&gt;[16:33] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; A transition is when a package migrates from -proposed to -release after Britney and autopkgtest verifies that this won't break anything.&lt;br/&gt;[16:34] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (won't break anything = passes all five points at the top of https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ProposedMigration)&lt;br/&gt;[16:34] &lt;rbasak&gt; I think you're describing proposed migration as opposed to a transition&lt;br/&gt;[16:35] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; for some reason I didn't realize there was a difference, we call it a "python3 transition" when the python3-default package is uploaded.&lt;br/&gt;[16:36] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; since that triggers a whole web of autopkgtests and if any of those fail, then the package is blocked and the failures need to be fixed before the transition can migrate&lt;br/&gt;[16:36] &lt;rbasak&gt; It's true that a transition should hold up proposed migration until it is complete, so the two concepts are very closely linked.&lt;br/&gt;[16:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; And you're right that autopkgtest failures hold up proposed migrations&lt;br/&gt;[16:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; ie. there are multiple things that hold up proposed migration, and one of those is that there's a transition in progress&lt;br/&gt;[16:38] &lt;rbasak&gt; It's possible that you understand what I'm looking for and we're just getting stuck in terminology&lt;br/&gt;[16:39] &lt;rbasak&gt; Let's say that src:foo 1.0 is in the archive, and it produces binary packages libfoo1 which various packages depend on, and libfoo-dev which those packages build depend on.&lt;br/&gt;[16:39] &lt;rbasak&gt; What are the implications of uploading src:foo 2.0, which moves on to libfoo2?&lt;br/&gt;[16:39] &lt;rbasak&gt; In relation to proposed migration?&lt;br/&gt;[16:40] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; API breaking changes which would very likely cause autopkgtest failures due to the need for the entangled packages to be updated to use the new API.&lt;br/&gt;[16:40] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; in which case you end up with multiple interrelated packages migrating together once everything passes the proposed migration tests.&lt;br/&gt;[16:41] &lt;rbasak&gt; Let's pretend that there are no autopkgtests in any of the relevant packages, so nothing is held up by autopkgtest failures&lt;br/&gt;[16:41] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (er, sorry, I mean reverse dependencies when I say entangled packages)&lt;br/&gt;[16:41] &lt;rbasak&gt; Why would proposed migration be held up?&lt;br/&gt;[16:41] &lt;rbasak&gt; Why would proposed migration _still_ be held up?&lt;br/&gt;[16:41] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Lots of possible reasons: it could no longer build and publish on an architecture it used to...&lt;br/&gt;[16:42] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; ...there could be dependency issues that would result in unsatisfied dependencies if the package(s) migrate...&lt;br/&gt;[16:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; What dependency issues exactly?&lt;br/&gt;[16:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; My example is the common case of a completely routine transition, so my expectation is that you should be able to follow and give me the specific dependency issue that would hold things up&lt;br/&gt;[16:43] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Anything that would cause apt to be unable to install the package were it in the archive, i.e. a dependency is missing or the proper version isn't available because (for instance) one of the reverse depends isn't updated to use the new version of the library.&lt;br/&gt;[16:43] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; so for a concrete example:&lt;br/&gt;[16:43] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; src:libfoo 1.0 exists, and package bar 1.0 depends on it.&lt;br/&gt;[16:43] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; libfoo2 is uploaded.&lt;br/&gt;[16:44] &lt;rbasak&gt; package bar 1.0 depends on what exactly?&lt;br/&gt;[16:44] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; bar 1.0 depends on libfoo1.&lt;br/&gt;[16:44] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; hold on, I'm getting slightly mixed up&lt;br/&gt;[16:45] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; so src:libfoo 1.0 is uploaded, bar 1.0 is uploaded which has a Depends: libfoo1 (= 1.0), then src:libfoo 2.0 is uploaded.&lt;br/&gt;[16:46] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; now bar 1.0 can no longer satisfy its dependency, so bar 2.0 has to be uploaded also before they can migrate together.&lt;br/&gt;[16:47] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK I think you have enough of an understanding there. Though note that a straight rebuild of bar 1.0 might be sufficient, since it's the ABI that changed, and it's possible that the API remains the same or that bar uses a small enough subset that it works without changes against foo 2.&lt;br/&gt;[16:47] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; True.&lt;br/&gt;[16:47] &lt;rbasak&gt; So, going back a few steps, what exactly would you be looking for to see if you're going to inadvertently trigger this kind of situation?&lt;br/&gt;[16:48] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; ah, I get it better now. Soname bumps mainly, but also versioned Depends since it's not just shared objects that can cause transitions.&lt;br/&gt;[16:48] &lt;rbasak&gt; At least in the common case. I realise an exhaustive search is difficult, but what are the most common indicators?&lt;br/&gt;[16:48] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; so if I build libfoo and end up with libfoo2 when I had libfoo1, that's a red flag.&lt;br/&gt;[16:48] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK. Thanks!&lt;br/&gt;[16:49] &lt;rbasak&gt; My next question was going to be about proposed migration but I think you've covered that enough already :)&lt;br/&gt;[16:49] &lt;rbasak&gt; Next question: when is feature freeze for Noble, where would I look up that information, and who can authorise an exception and where is that process documented?&lt;br/&gt;[16:50] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; The page where the freezes are documented for Noble is at https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/noble-numbat-release-schedule/35649. According to that calendar, Feature Freeze is February 29, 2024.&lt;br/&gt;[16:51] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; The freeze exception process is documented at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FreezeExceptionProcess.&lt;br/&gt;[16:51] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; the Release Team are the ones who can ACK an FFe.&lt;br/&gt;[16:52] &lt;rbasak&gt; Let's say that you'd like to upload new upstream release of foo 1.2.2, and 1.2.1 is currently in the archive, and it's March 1st. Is that acceptable? Or if that's not enough information, what extra information do you need to make a decision?&lt;br/&gt;[16:53] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Not enough information - what versioning scheme does foo 1.2.2 use? Is is a purely bugfix release? Or could it incorporate new features or breaking changes?&lt;br/&gt;[16:54] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Assuming it uses semver, an upload of 1.2.2 is *probably* OK since 1.2.1 -&gt; 1.2.2 is a patch release.&lt;br/&gt;[16:55] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (I say probably since upstream might not strictly adhere to the rule of only making backwards-compatible bug fixes in a patch release, if they do make breaking API changes that's still a no-no)&lt;br/&gt;[16:55] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (or if they introduce new API at all)&lt;br/&gt;[16:56] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; if for some reason the patch release is really important and isn't suitable for introduction after Feature Freeze, then I would either backport the parts of the release that are Feature Freeze compatible that I need, or request an FFe if necessary. That would have to be decided on a case-by-case basis.&lt;br/&gt;[16:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK. Thanks!&lt;br/&gt;[16:58] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm just looking at your "regular" SRU history&lt;br/&gt;[16:58] &lt;rbasak&gt; I only see bug 1989203.

we worked short hours with skeleton crews, no MIRs were worked&lt;br/&gt;[15:44] &lt;eslerm&gt; pydantic has a draft review done :)&lt;br/&gt;[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: understandable&lt;br/&gt;[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm: lovely&lt;br/&gt;[15:45] &lt;sarnold&gt; iirc libmysofa had some communication with upstream via private email infrastructure that worked better than via canonical email infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; which is the last to get jaraco out of the picture&lt;br/&gt;[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: yeah you mentioned there were issues, still odd&lt;br/&gt;[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; well, that is more than I could expect given most were out&lt;br/&gt;[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt;

my guess is no: luna likes to follow along with the various meetings equally&lt;br/&gt;[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hmm, not around&lt;br/&gt;[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; which I'm happy to hear&lt;br/&gt;[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt;

As the release team knows, I have a short draft that I need to make public somewhere&lt;br/&gt;[20:05] &lt;sil2100&gt; I'll discuss with the release team on the best placement for that&lt;br/&gt;[20:05] &lt;sil2100&gt; Anything to add before I carry it over?&lt;br/&gt;[20:05] &lt;vorlon&gt; no; I think it's clearly carry-over&lt;br/&gt;[20:05] &lt;sil2100&gt; #action seb128 to continue working with SRU, AA, Release, Backporters and Security teams to document their membership process and link to it from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TechnicalBoard#Team_Delegations&lt;br/&gt;[20:05] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: seb128 to continue working with SRU, AA, Release, Backporters and Security teams to document their membership process and link to it from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TechnicalBoard#Team_Delegations&lt;br/&gt;[20:06] &lt;rbasak-mobile&gt; I think the SRU side is done on the ML and just meeds transferring to formal docs&lt;br/&gt;[20:06] &lt;sil2100&gt; Some carry overs:&lt;br/&gt;[20:06] &lt;sil2100&gt; #action vorlon to write up draft guidelines for packages in the archive that download from the Internet&lt;br/&gt;[20:06] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: vorlon to write up draft guidelines for packages in the archive that download from the Internet&lt;br/&gt;[20:06] &lt;sil2100&gt; #action seb128 to follow-up with ubuntu cinnamon on 24.04 request&lt;br/&gt;[20:06] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: seb128 to follow-up with ubuntu cinnamon on 24.04 request&lt;br/&gt;[20:06] &lt;sil2100&gt; Now an action for me, but I think it's actually done:&lt;br/&gt;[20:06] &lt;sil2100&gt; ACTION: sil2100 to follow-up with ubuntu studio on 24.04 request&lt;br/&gt;[20:07] &lt;sil2100&gt; In my latest reply to the LTS qualification, I signed off it with my TB hat&lt;br/&gt;[20:07] &lt;sil2100&gt; So I consider this one done&lt;br/&gt;[20:08] &lt;sil2100&gt; (no carry over)&lt;br/&gt;[20:08] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; I have Lubuntu's draft LTS qualification on my desk and ready for a final ack today.

As far as I was aware, that wasn't a hard requirement.&lt;br/&gt;[20:09] &lt;vorlon&gt; sil2100: you're signing off as an individual TB member?  I think it's better governance-wise to have TB votes on these, as in the example of ubuntu-unity&lt;br/&gt;[20:10] &lt;sil2100&gt; vorlon: oh, I was not aware that was the process&lt;br/&gt;[20:10] &lt;vorlon&gt; well the wiki page says "TB" not "a member of the TB"&lt;br/&gt;[20:10] &lt;sil2100&gt; vorlon: I thought in the past I saw it being single people signing off&lt;br/&gt;[20:10] &lt;sil2100&gt; Then we can vote for that for sure&lt;br/&gt;[20:11] &lt;sil2100&gt; #vote Signing off on Ubuntu Studio on 24.04 LTS request&lt;br/&gt;[20:11] &lt;meetingology&gt; Please vote on: Signing off on Ubuntu Studio on 24.04 LTS request&lt;br/&gt;[20:11] &lt;meetingology&gt; Public votes can be registered by saying +1, -1 or +0 in channel (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1|-1|+0 #channelname')&lt;br/&gt;[20:11] &lt;sil2100&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[20:11] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 received from sil2100&lt;br/&gt;[20:11] &lt;vorlon&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[20:11] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 received from vorlon&lt;br/&gt;[20:11] &lt;amurray&gt; +1&lt;br/&gt;[20:11] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 received from amurray&lt;br/&gt;[20:12] &lt;rbasak-mobile&gt; +1 see ML thread - I'm merely choosing to follow sil2100 and vorlon here.&lt;br/&gt;[20:12] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 see ML thread - I'm merely choosing to follow sil2100 and vorlon here. received from rbasak-mobile&lt;br/&gt;[20:12] &lt;vorlon&gt; addendum: we ought to make sure we have some central place collecting the state of LTS sign-off for all the flavors&lt;br/&gt;[20:12] &lt;sil2100&gt; #endvote&lt;br/&gt;[20:12] &lt;meetingology&gt; Voting ended on: Signing off on Ubuntu Studio on 24.04 LTS request&lt;br/&gt;[20:12] &lt;meetingology&gt; Votes for: 4, Votes against: 0, Abstentions: 0&lt;br/&gt;[20:12] &lt;meetingology&gt; Motion carried&lt;br/&gt;[20:12] &lt;sil2100&gt; vorlon: +1 on that too!&lt;br/&gt;[20:12] &lt;sil2100&gt; For now I'll follow up on the thread, let me add an action for that&lt;br/&gt;[20:13] &lt;sil2100&gt; #action sil2100 to send confirmation of successful LTS status for Ubuntu Studio 24.04&lt;br/&gt;[20:13] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: sil2100 to send confirmation of successful LTS status for Ubuntu Studio 24.04&lt;br/&gt;[20:13] &lt;sil2100&gt; Back to the previous action item&lt;br/&gt;[20:13] &lt;vorlon&gt; do we want it in the 24.04 release notes in the discourse, or do we want it in a wiki page?&lt;br/&gt;[20:14] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; addendum&gt; There is an existing Discourse thread tracking information about 24.04 participation that also includes these details. I would suggest to the TB that they should manage a Discourse post with the official list.&lt;br/&gt;[20:14] &lt;sil2100&gt; amurray: do you consider this a hard requirement for the policy to be made available right now, or would you be happy for this happening later?&lt;br/&gt;[20:14] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; #link https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/responses-needed-flavor-participation-for-24-04-lts/40075&lt;br/&gt;[20:14] &lt;amurray&gt; no I don't consider it a hard policy but I think we would definitely want it before the release goes live&lt;br/&gt;[20:14] &lt;amurray&gt; s/policy/requirement/&lt;br/&gt;[20:15] &lt;sil2100&gt; amurray: +1 indeed&lt;br/&gt;[20:15] &lt;sil2100&gt; amurray: if you're fine with the request otherwise, do you want to vote for it now?&lt;br/&gt;[20:15] &lt;vorlon&gt; as long as the flavor commits to having it up by release time, regardless of domain hosting status&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;sil2100&gt; Eickmeyer: ^ is that something you can commit to?&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; That puts Edubuntu in a rough situation with our current hosting situation. We simply do *not* have a place to put it.&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;rbasak-mobile&gt; It seems weird to be waiting just because of an issue with publication in a particular place. I suggest just using Discourse in the meantime and so whether it is blocking or not shouldn't even need to be a question.&lt;br/&gt;[20:16] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; We're working with Aaron Prisk to get IS to work on this, but they don't have it as a priority item.&lt;br/&gt;[20:17] &lt;sil2100&gt; So maybe like this: if by around release time the hosting situation is still not solved, would it be possible for you to publish a discourse post with all the details instead?&lt;br/&gt;[20:17] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; sil2100: It will be in the release notes for sure if the hosting situation isn't resolved. Our release notes have been published to Discourse in the meantime.&lt;br/&gt;[20:17] &lt;vorlon&gt; NB hosting of per-flavor websites is not listed on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecognizedFlavors as part of what Canonical commits to&lt;br/&gt;[20:18] &lt;sil2100&gt; Eickmeyer: that sounds like a good plan B to me&lt;br/&gt;[20:18] &lt;sil2100&gt; amurray WDYT?&lt;br/&gt;[20:18] &lt;amurray&gt; works for me&lt;br/&gt;[20:18] &lt;sil2100&gt; Let's vote&lt;br/&gt;[20:18] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; vorlon: Edubuntu used to be hosted by Canonical, and Ubuntu Studio currently is, along with Kubuntu, so there's precident.&lt;br/&gt;[20:19] &lt;sil2100&gt; #vote Signing off on Edubuntu 24.04 LTS request&lt;br/&gt;[20:19] &lt;meetingology&gt; Please vote on: Signing off on Edubuntu 24.04 LTS request&lt;br/&gt;[20:19] &lt;meetingology&gt; Public votes can be registered by saying +1, -1 or +0 in channel (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1|-1|+0 #channelname')&lt;br/&gt;[20:19] &lt;rbasak-mobile&gt; No precedent for an SLA though.

I might have missed any ML threads regarding this&lt;br/&gt;[20:24] &lt;amurray&gt; I proposed voting via email yesterday&lt;br/&gt;[20:24] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; rbasak-mobile: There is existing precedence for flavors to ask Canonical to host infrastructure, however, to my knowledge it's been a courtesy rather than a requirement. For example, our domain is hosted by Canonical, and if that goes down, that would certainly reflect poorly on our qualification efforts.&lt;br/&gt;[20:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; since the UbuntuKylin vote has already been called on the mailing list I propose we continue it there rather than voting in the meeting&lt;br/&gt;[20:25] &lt;sil2100&gt; amurray: do you want to vote here instead?&lt;br/&gt;[20:25] &lt;amurray&gt; I think email is fine&lt;br/&gt;[20:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; ACK o/&lt;br/&gt;[20:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; I'll carry it over then&lt;br/&gt;[20:26] &lt;rbasak-mobile&gt; I agree but again this shouldn't be relevant or seen as blocking. We can be pragmatic and just publish somewhere else eg. Discourse. Not need for this to formally block anything.&lt;br/&gt;[20:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; #action amurray to follow-up with ubuntu kylin on 24.04 request&lt;br/&gt;[20:26] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: amurray to follow-up with ubuntu kylin on 24.04 request&lt;br/&gt;[20:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; Okay, let's move on&lt;br/&gt;[20:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; #topic Scan the mailing list archive for anything we missed&lt;br/&gt;[20:26] &lt;vorlon&gt; note that there is also CFV on the mailing list for Ubuntu Unity&lt;br/&gt;[20:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; which wasn't assigned to me in the TB meeting when they were being assigned because I wasn't able to attend, instead I just picked up the ones that hadn't been assigned&lt;br/&gt;=== JanC_ is now known as JanC&lt;br/&gt;[20:27] &lt;sil2100&gt; I'll try to follow up on those with votes then&lt;br/&gt;[20:27] &lt;sil2100&gt; I think there are no actionable items on the ML that do not have actions already, from what I know?&lt;br/&gt;[20:28] &lt;sil2100&gt; Since we have the participation e-mails, the process thread, and all those have action items assigned&lt;br/&gt;[20:28] &lt;rbasak-mobile&gt; I think it's worth following up on a multitude of issues raised by the mutter regression but I'll follow up on the list first, hopefully this week.&lt;br/&gt;[20:28] &lt;sil2100&gt; rbasak-mobile: thanks&lt;br/&gt;[20:28] &lt;sil2100&gt; #topic Check up on community bugs and techboard bugs'&lt;br/&gt;[20:29] &lt;sil2100&gt; Nothing new there&lt;br/&gt;[20:29] &lt;sil2100&gt; #topic Select a chair for the next meeting&lt;br/&gt;[20:29] &lt;sil2100&gt; That would be amurray, with rbasak-mobile as backup&lt;br/&gt;[20:29] &lt;sil2100&gt; If that'&lt;br/&gt;[20:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; I'm very confused by that&lt;br/&gt;[20:29] &lt;sil2100&gt; If that's fine&lt;br/&gt;[20:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; the wiki page said it was supposed to be seb128 with me as backup&lt;br/&gt;[20:30] &lt;sil2100&gt; Well, amurray is next after me, right?&lt;br/&gt;[20:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; are we just jumping the pointer?&lt;br/&gt;[20:30] &lt;sil2100&gt; I have volunteered today as I have not chaired for quite a long time&lt;br/&gt;[20:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; I don't mind, it's just not historical practice :)&lt;br/&gt;[20:31] &lt;sil2100&gt; #topic AOB&lt;br/&gt;[20:31] &lt;amurray&gt; fwiw I think I am on leave during the next scheduled TB meeting so not sure if I will be able to make it at this time&lt;br/&gt;[20:31] &lt;sil2100&gt; Ah, so maybe back to the scheduled chairs then? seb and vorlon as backup?&lt;br/&gt;[20:32] &lt;sil2100&gt; If there are no objections, I'd propose that then&lt;br/&gt;[20:32] &lt;sil2100&gt; Any other business?&lt;br/&gt;[20:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; nothing else from me&lt;br/&gt;[20:33] &lt;amurray&gt; nor from me&lt;br/&gt;[20:34] &lt;rbasak-mobile&gt; Please don't wait on everyone to say no :-)&lt;br/&gt;[20:35] &lt;sil2100&gt; ;)&lt;br/&gt;[20:35] &lt;sil2100&gt; #endmeeting&lt;br/&gt;[20:35] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting ended at 20:35:29 UTC.
